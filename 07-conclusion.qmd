# *Conclusion*

*The findings revealed significant disparities in resilience and social cohesion between IDPs and host communities. IDPs generally exhibited lower resilience levels, which were associated with poorer housing conditions, lower income satisfaction, and more frequent displacement. Key factors such as type of shelter, availability of healthcare, education opportunities, and infrastructure significantly influenced resilience levels. Social cohesion was found to have a profound impact on the well-being of both groups, with higher levels of social cohesion linked to better mental health outcomes and increased community support.*

*Importantly, the study highlighted the crucial role of various stakeholders, including government institutions, religious leaders, and tribal sheiks, in enhancing resilience. Support from these entities was significantly associated with higher resilience scores among IDPs. The data underscored the necessity of targeted interventions to address the specific needs of IDPs, particularly in improving access to healthcare, education, and infrastructure, as well as fostering supportive community environments. The study's findings underscore the need for comprehensive policies and programs that promote social cohesion and resilience to enhance the overall well-being of both IDPs and host communities.*
