# Conclusion and Recommendations

## Conclusion

The findings revealed significant disparities in resilience and social cohesion between IDPs and host communities. IDPs generally exhibited lower resilience levels, which were associated with poorer housing conditions, lower income satisfaction, and more frequent displacement. Key factors such as type of shelter, availability of healthcare, education opportunities, and infrastructure significantly influenced resilience levels. Social cohesion was found to have a profound impact on the well-being of both groups, with higher levels of social cohesion linked to better mental health outcomes and increased community support.

Importantly, the study highlighted the crucial role of various stakeholders, including government institutions, religious leaders, and tribal sheiks, in enhancing resilience. Support from these entities was significantly associated with higher resilience scores among IDPs.

## Recommendations

1.  **Enhance Access to Basic Services:**

    Improve the accessibility and availability of healthcare, education and infrastructure services for IDPs by establishing more healthcare facilities, more schools, as well as infrastructure in proximity to IDP settlements and ensuring these facilities are well-equipped and staffed.

2.  **Promote Social Cohesion Initiatives:**

    -   **Community Integration Programs:** Develop and implement programs that promote interaction and cooperation between IDPs and host community members, such as community events, joint projects, and cultural exchange activities.

    -   **Conflict Resolution Mechanisms:** Establish conflict resolution and mediation centers to address disputes and foster harmonious relationships within and between communities.

    -   **Awareness Campaigns:** Conduct awareness campaigns to educate both IDPs and host communities on the benefits of social cohesion and collective resilience.

3.  **Strengthen Support Systems:**

    -   **Government Interventions:** Encourage active involvement of government institutions in providing financial, legal, and social support to IDPs to enhance their resilience.

    -   **Community Leaders:** Engage religious leaders and tribal sheiks in community support programs to foster trust and cohesion among IDPs and host communities.

    -   **NGOs:** Increase the presence and activities of NGOs focused on providing psychosocial support, vocational training, and community development programs.

4.  **Economic Empowerment:**

    -   **Job Creation Programs:** Create job opportunities tailored to the skills and needs of IDPs through partnerships with local businesses and industries.

    -   **Entrepreneurship Support:** Provide training, resources, and micro-financing options to encourage entrepreneurship among IDPs, helping them to establish sustainable livelihoods.
