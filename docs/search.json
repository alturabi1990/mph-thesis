    "section": "",
    "text": "A thesis submitted for the degree of Master of Public Health “MPH” at International University of Africa (IUA), Faculty of Medicine\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: The ongoing conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) since April 15, 2023, has triggered a severe humanitarian crisis in Sudan, displacing over 3 million people. This crisis has intensified vulnerabilities such as food insecurity and social tensions within host communities, exacerbating competition for resources and threatening social cohesion. This study aims to explore the dynamics between internally displaced persons (IDPs) and host communities to enhance resilience and integration. The objectives are to assess social cohesion, measure resilience, identify influential factors, and evaluate the impact of social cohesion on well-being to guide effective intervention strategies. Methods: An analytical cross-sectional study was conducted in the River Nile state, focusing on adults aged 18 and above from both IDP and host communities impacted by the conflict. Data were collected via a self-structured questionnaire, administered face-to-face by trained research assistants using the Kobocollect mobile app. Statistical analyses, using R, included descriptive and inferential statistics to explore relationships between variables. Ethical approvals and gatekeepers’ permissions were obtained, and consent was secured from all participants, adhering to confidentiality and privacy standards. Results: The study comprised 410 participants—260 IDPs and 150 host community members. Significant socio-economic differences were noted: IDPs had a median age of 31 years, with higher rates of university (48% vs. 40%) and post-graduate education (25% vs. 11%) compared to host community members (p &lt; 0.001). Post-conflict, IDPs saw a decrease in professional employment (44% to 19%) and an increase in unemployment (42% vs. 34%) (p &lt; 0.001). Social cohesion was assessed through friendships and community engagement. Among IDPs, 47% had few friends within the host community and 59% felt welcomed, but 69% had average social integration scores. Perceived discrimination negatively impacted social cohesion, with those experiencing it reporting lower integration levels (p &lt; 0.001). Resilience analysis showed that 26% of participants had low psychological well-being, with IDPs particularly affected (29% vs. 20% for host community members) (p &lt; 0.001). Overall, while some integration was observed, IDPs faced significant challenges affecting their social cohesion and resilience. Discussion: The study highlights substantial socio-economic disparities and variations in social cohesion and resilience between IDPs and host community members in River Nile State. IDPs experienced greater challenges in housing, income, and employment. Despite these issues, high levels of social integration and shared values were evident. Resilience scores indicated lower psychological well-being and preparedness among IDPs compared to host community members. The findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to improve social cohesion and address the specific needs of IDPs for better integration and support. Conclusion: The study reveals that while there is some degree of social cohesion between IDPs and host communities, IDPs face significant challenges, including economic instability and lower psychological well-being. Discrimination negatively impacts social integration, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to enhance resilience and strengthen social cohesion.\n\n\n\nDeclaration\nThis thesis is an original work of my research and contains no material which has been accepted for the award of any other degree or diploma at any university or equivalent institution and that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, this thesis contains no material previously published or written by another person, except where due reference is made in the text of the thesis.\nStudent name: Elhami A.A.

    "text": "1.1 Background\nMigration and displacement rates have reached unprecedented levels globally in recent years due to conflicts, natural disasters, and other humanitarian crises. Approximately one in seven people living outside their country of origin, totaling over 258 million individuals. Out of these, 89.3 million people have been forcibly displaced, including 27.1 million refugees, 4.6 million asylum seekers, and 53.2 million internally displaced persons (IDPs). It is worth noting that a significant proportion of these displaced individuals are women and children. (International labor organization, 2022)\nThe consequences of forced displacement’s length and intensity often extend beyond individual circumstances. IDPs often face numerous challenges in terms of social integration, access to basic services, employment opportunities, and psychological well-being. These difficulties can lead to social disruption, tensions, grievances, social fragmentation, and economic upheaval between IDPs among themselves and between host communities. This will often lead to challenges to the social cohesion of IDPs & host communities.(International labor organization, 2022)\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines a cohesive society as “one that works towards the well-being of all members, minimizing disparities, and avoiding marginalization” (OECD, 2011). A concept called the Humanitarian, Development, and Peace Nexus (HDPN) which emphasizes the importance of social cohesion between displaced populations and host communities for peace, stability, and integration. (International labor organization, 2022)\nThis is achieved through combating discrimination, social exclusion, and inequalities, building social capital through networks, trust, and identity among different societal groups, and enabling upward social mobility (OECD, 2011).\nIn Sudan, a conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Rapid Support Forces (RSF) began on April 15, 2023, the humanitarian situation in Sudan has worsened, with millions of people being displaced (ReliefWeb, 2023) . Here are some key points about the situation:\n- Displacement: More than 3 million people have been internally displaced across 18 states due to the ongoing conflict between the SAF and RSF . As of July 4, 2023, more than 2.8 million people had been displaced due to the conflict (International Organization for Migration (IOM), 2024). The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) estimates that up to 1 million people may flee to neighboring countries. Family separations are a major protection risk and concern. About 90,000 people (18,000 to 19,000 households) were displaced across several displacement camps near Tawila town, according to the IOM Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM).\n- Humanitarian needs: Since the outbreak of the conflict, it is estimated that about 25 million people urgently need humanitarian assistance in the country, representing over half of Sudan’s inhabitants. The crisis has triggered large-scale population movements, both within Sudan and in the region. Sudan was already experiencing a humanitarian crisis before the conflict broke out, with more than 15 million people facing severe food insecurity and more than 3.7 million internally displaced persons. Sudan hosts more than 1.1 million refugees – one of the highest numbers in Africa – and almost all require humanitarian assistance (International Organization for Migration (IOM), 2024).\n- Violence: At least 1,081 deaths and about 11,714 injuries have been recorded since the start of the conflict across the country, according to the Federal Ministry of Health. Clashes between the SAF and RSF have continued, particularly in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Darfur states. In North Darfur, clashes broke out in Tawila town on June 16, leading to killing and injury of civilians, including internally displaced people and widespread displacement (Ferragamo & Roy, 2024).\n- Impact on vulnerable groups: The conflict has made many groups vulnerable due to displacement and conflict (ReliefWeb, 2023). Family separations are a major protection risk and concern. Children are particularly vulnerable, with 450,000 newly displaced children as of May 30, 2023. Women and girls are also at risk of gender-based violence, including sexual violence. The conflict has also worsened an already precarious humanitarian situation, with more than 15 million people facing severe food insecurity and more than 3.7 million internally displaced persons (ReliefWeb, 2023).\nThe humanitarian situation in Sudan is dire, with millions of people being displaced and in need of urgent assistance. The conflict has worsened an already precarious situation, with many vulnerable groups at risk of violence and displacement.\nHost communities often have better access to housing, services, and formal and informal employment opportunities compared to displaced families. Consequently, displaced individuals face disadvantages resulting from limited social networks, reliance on state assistance, and difficulties accessing labor markets (ICRC, 2012).\nRelations between host communities and displaced persons are complex, subject to changes and modifications as a result of massive displacements that alter the population profiles of host regions (International labor organization, 2022). Initially, there may be expressions of solidarity and support from friends and family members when IDPs first arrive. However, these positive sentiments often fade due to limited resources within the host community (ICRC, 2012)\nThe influx of a large number of displaced people can be perceived by host communities as competition for jobs, potentially reducing wages and working conditions (International labor organization, 2022). This further contributes to a lack of trust and can lead to social tensions, as the perception of increased competition for resources undermines social cohesion and perpetuates feelings of social injustice and exclusion (International labor organization, 2022).",

    "section": "1.2 Problem Statement",
    "text": "1.2 Problem Statement\nHosting IDPs can exacerbate the impoverishment of the host family and cause different forms of exploitation within and between the hosted and the hosts. Host communities may suffer from having to share inadequate resources with sudden influxes of IDPs or from gradual depletion of resources over time. IDPs may come to be seen as unwelcome and be targeted for discrimination - or worse. For all these reasons it is becoming urgent to learn more about IDPs living with host families and to devise systematic tools and approaches to protect and assist them, where necessary (Davies, 2012).\nHigh levels of social cohesion are linked to numerous positive outcomes, such as environmental sustainability, social stability, improved health, and effective responses to societal challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic. Social cohesion fosters a sense of community, cooperation, trust, and solidarity among society’s members. Communities with high social cohesion levels are likely to experience lower conflict, crime rates, and social unrest, leading to overall well-being and resilience (Moustakas, 2023).\nTo address these challenges, it is important to raise awareness among host communities about the experiences and needs of IDPs. Additionally, reviewing policies of assistance to displaced populations with a long-term perspective is essential (ICRC, 2012).",

Understanding the factors that contribute to positive interactions between IDPs and host communities will enable policymakers, humanitarian organizations, and local authorities to design targeted interventions that address the specific needs of both groups.\nThe purpose of this research is to investigate the factors that contribute/hinder to social cohesion between internally displaced people (IDPs) and host communities. Our study would contribute to identify effective strategies and interventions that can be implemented to address the specific needs and challenges faced in order to foster positive relationships, mutual understanding, and cooperation between these two groups. By investigating social cohesion & resilience, this research seeks to enhance the overall well-being and integration of IDPs within their host communities.",

    "text": "2.1 Definitions, Causes, and Consequences of Social Cohesion\nDefinition of Social Cohesion Social cohesion is a vital element of a peaceful and resilient society, especially in the context of increasing forced migration worldwide (Bulbul Siddiqi, 2022). It is characterized by positive social relations, a sense of belonging, and an orientation towards the common good (Moustakas, 2023). Despite its importance, the concept lacks a universally accepted definition, creating ambiguity among NGOs working in refugee contexts. Guay (2016) offers a relevant definition, describing social cohesion as “the set of relationships between individuals and groups in a particular environment and between those individuals and groups and the institutions that govern them” (World bank group, 2023).\nSocial cohesion involves shared values, norms, and beliefs, fostering a sense of belonging and unity within a community. This interconnectedness strengthens interpersonal relationships and promotes a collective identity that transcends individual differences, paving the way for inclusive and harmonious coexistence among diverse groups. This sense of belonging and unity is essential for creating a supportive environment where individuals feel connected and valued, leading to increased overall well-being and resilience (Moustakas, 2023).\nCauses of Social Cohesion Several factors influence social cohesion in different societal contexts. Inequality, particularly income inequality, is a significant cause that negatively impacts social cohesion. Institutions and governance play a crucial role in fostering social cohesion by emphasizing well-being, social participation, tolerance, and equal opportunities. The human capital accumulation theory suggests that inequality hinders educational opportunities for disadvantaged individuals, affecting their social mobility and, consequently, social cohesion (Moustakas, 2023).",

    "text": "2.2 Social Cohesion Dynamics in Refugee and Host Community Contexts\nImportance of Social Interaction Social interaction between the host and Rohingya communities is critical in fostering a cohesive relationship. Increased positive interactions can help bridge divides and build understanding. Emphasizing the importance of social interaction is a key factor in fostering a cohesive relationship between the host and Rohingya communities, highlighting the need for initiatives that promote mutual respect and peaceful coexistence (Bulbul Siddiqi, 2022).\nSocial Cohesion and Resilience Social cohesion and resilience are interconnected in a reciprocal relationship, as strong social cohesion can enhance a community’s ability to withstand adversity and bounce back from setbacks, while resilience can strengthen bonds and reinforce a sense of collective identity. Communities with high levels of social cohesion and resilience are better equipped to address social issues, promote positive mental health outcomes, and facilitate effective collaboration towards common goals. Fostering social cohesion and resilience can also reduce instances of social isolation and loneliness, lower crime and violence rates, and increase civic engagement and participation in local decision-making processes (Moustakas, 2023).",

    "section": "2.3 The components and dimensions of social cohesion & resilience can vary slightly in published literature:",
    "text": "2.3 The components and dimensions of social cohesion & resilience can vary slightly in published literature:\n1. Trust: Trust is an essential component of social cohesion. It refers to the belief and confidence that individuals and groups have in each other and in institutions (Delhey et al., 2018). Trust is built through positive social interactions, shared values, and a sense of reliability and fairness, which can facilitate cooperation, mutual support, and collective action (Schiefer & Van Der Noll, 2017).\nCommunity members describe trust building as the most important precondition for the various components of society to be in solidarity and support each other. What trust building means varies from individual to individual and, to a certain extent, from area to area. Other necessary social cohesion actions are: promoting the spirit of tolerance, social interaction, making communities more homogeneous (ethno-religiously) and sensitizing community leaders (World bank group, 2023).\n2. Inclusive identity and Belonging: Inclusive identity refers to a sense of belonging and attachment to a social group or community. It involves recognizing and valuing diversity (cultural, ethnic, and religious) while fostering a shared sense of identity and common values (Delhey et al., 2018; Schiefer & Van Der Noll, 2017)\n3. Social Integration and Inclusion: Social cohesion is enhanced when IDPs are integrated into host communities, rather than being isolated or marginalized. This involves ensuring equal access to essential services, education, healthcare, employment opportunities, and participation in decision-making processes (Joanna P. de Berry, 2018).\n4. Cooperation for shared goals: Cooperation for the common good refers to individuals and groups working together towards shared goals and collective well-being. It involves collaboration, solidarity, and a willingness to contribute to the betterment of society (Delhey et al., 2018).\n5. Social relations: Social relations encompass the quality and strength of interpersonal connections and networks within a community. This includes strong social networks, supportive relationships, and a sense of community belonging (Schiefer & Van Der Noll, 2017).\n5. Participation: Participation refers to the active engagement of individuals and groups in public life and decision-making processes. It involves having a voice, being included, and having opportunities to contribute to social, economic, and political activities.\n6. Connectedness: Connectedness refers to the level of interconnectedness and interdependence among individuals and groups within a society. It encompasses a sense of solidarity, shared values, and a recognition of the interrelationships between different social groups. This can be found in terms of joint community projects, income-generation activities, and initiatives that foster collaboration and interdependence (Schiefer & Van Der Noll, 2017).\n7. Conflict Resolution and Reconciliation: Addressing conflicts and promoting reconciliation is vital for social cohesion and resilience. This includes promoting dialogue, mediation, and peacebuilding initiatives to resolve tensions and heal divisions arising from displacement (Joanna P. de Berry, 2018).\n8. Resilience and Coping Mechanisms: Promoting resilience involves strengthening the capacity of IDPs and host communities to withstand and recover from shocks or stresses. This includes supporting social support systems, providing psychosocial services, and fostering adaptive strategies for communities to cope with challenges (MacIsaac et al., 2023).\n9. Communication and Information Sharing: Effective communication channels and information sharing platforms facilitate understanding and promote cohesion between IDPs and host communities. This includes ensuring transparent and inclusive communication to address grievances, disseminate relevant information, and promote dialogue (Jenson, 2010)\nThese components and dimensions of social cohesion and resilience contribute to the overall strength and resilience of communities, fostering a sense of unity, cooperation, and well-being.\nBuilding Social Cohesion and Resilience among IDPs and Host Communities Social cohesion and resilience between internally displaced persons (IDPs) and host communities are crucial for sustainable integration and harmony. Fostering mutual understanding and cooperation through community engagement initiatives can bridge the gap between IDPs and host communities, promoting long-term stability and peaceful coexistence. Research indicates that social capital, including trust, interaction, and networks, plays a significant role in building resilience among displaced women by reducing poverty, increasing empowerment, and decreasing violence. Approaches to enhance social cohesion involve providing basic services without limiting the host community, economic integration, and support services for local integration. IDPs demonstrate resilience by establishing internal camp management structures, advocating for their needs, and fostering supportive communal relationships, showcasing their active role in adaptation and development (Bulbul Siddiqi, 2022).\nConsequences of High Levels of Social Cohesion High levels of social cohesion are linked to numerous positive outcomes, such as environmental sustainability, social stability, improved health, and effective responses to societal challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic. Social cohesion fosters a sense of community, cooperation, trust, and solidarity among society’s members. Communities with high social cohesion levels are likely to experience lower conflict, crime rates, and social unrest, leading to overall well-being and resilience (Moustakas, 2023).\nChallenges in Refugee Management: The Case of the Rohingya in Bangladesh Research on social cohesion between the Rohingya and host communities in Bangladesh highlights several critical issues (Bulbul Siddiqi, 2022). The lack of a comprehensive refugee policy and the ad-hoc approach taken by the Bangladeshi government have hindered efforts to prioritize social cohesion. Negative perceptions and social tensions have increased among neighboring host communities towards the Rohingya, fueled by concerns about anti-social and unlawful activities attributed to the influx of refugees. Over the past four years, there has been a significant decline in the sympathetic attitude of the host community towards the Rohingya, straining relationships and hindering efforts towards social cohesion (Bulbul Siddiqi, 2022).\nEfforts to Address Social Cohesion Challenges Efforts to address social cohesion challenges in the Rohingya crisis in Bangladesh have included initiatives focused on promoting inter-community dialogue, enhancing economic opportunities for both IDPs and host communities, and fostering mutual understanding through cultural exchange programs. These initiatives aim to bridge the gap between the displaced population and the host communities, creating a more inclusive and harmonious environment. Community-based projects, such as joint infrastructure development and shared resource management, have proven effective in fostering collaboration and building trust among the different groups affected by the crisis. These collaborative efforts have not only improved living conditions for both IDPs and host communities but also laid the foundation for long-term peacebuilding and social cohesion in the region (Bulbul Siddiqi, 2022).\n\n\n\n\nBulbul Siddiqi.

Taken from 6 localities, as Eldamer had the highest overall representation (30%), followed by Atbara (27%) and Shendi (17%). Then least localities with AbuHamad, Elmatama, and Barbar by (13%, 11%, and 2%) respectively.\nAfter doing the normality testings using Shapiro-Wilk tests on our numerical variables. As shown in the Table 5.1, all of our variables are not normality distributed. So, we reported the univariate analysis results as median (Mdn)and interquartile range (IQR) and in bivariate hypothesis testing using appropriate tests(Pearson’s Chi-squared test, Wilcoxon rank sum test and Fisher’s exact test).\nSociodemographic Characteristics\nThe Table 5.2 and Table 5.3 below provide a breakdown of the socio-demographic characteristics for each group. The study population had a median age of 31 years (IQR: 25-43), with a gender distribution of 64% female and 36% males. Marital status varied, with 49% married, 44% signle and 3.4% divorced or widowed. The study reveals significant socio-economic differences between IDPs and host community members. Educational levels significantly differed, with more IDPs having university (48% vs. 40%) and post-graduate education (25% vs. 11%) (p &lt; .001). Occupation post-conflict showed a significant shift, with professional employment decreasing among IDPs (from 44% to 19%) and unemployment rising (42% vs. 34%) (p &lt; .001). IDPs more frequently lived in host communities (42%) and rented accommodations (22%) than host community members, who predominantly owned homes (82%) (p &lt; .001). Housing conditions also varied significantly, with fewer IDPs reporting good conditions (28% vs. 48%) (p &lt; .001). Median monthly income before the conflict was higher for IDPs (Mdn = 200) than for host community members (Mdn = 120) (p &lt; .001), but post-conflict income levels showed no significant difference (p = .4). Income satisfaction was low overall, with no significant group difference (p = .062) as shown in Figure 5.1 and Table 5.3 .\nWhen looking at displacement pattern through Figure 5.2 using Sankey diagram illustrating the movement of displaced persons from various states due to conflict, providing a visual representation of the origins and destinations of these individuals. The nodes on the left side of the diagram represent the states of origin, while the ones on the right side denote the localities where displaced persons have relocated. The analysis reveals that Khartoum (215/240) is the highest state of origin, contributing the largest number of displaced persons. Following Khartoum, Aj Jazerah and River Nile are the next significant states of origin. In contrast, Sennar, Red Sea, and White Nile have contributed the least number of displaced persons.\n\n\n\nTable 5.2: Descriptive Statistics of Participants’ Demographic Characteristics\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive Statistics of Demographic Information Stratified by Displacement status\n\nVariable\nN\n\nOverall, N = 410\n1\n\n\nHost community member, N = 150\n1\n\n\nIDP, N = 260\n1\n\n\n\n\nGender\n410\n\n\n\n\n\n    Female\n\n264 (64%)\n108 (72%)\n156 (60%)\n\n\n    Male\n\n146 (36%)\n42 (28%)\n104 (40%)\n\n\nAge\n410\n31 (25, 43)\n33 (26, 46)\n31 (25, 40)\n\n\nMarital Status\n410\n\n\n\n\n\n    Divorced\n\n14 (3.4%)\n6 (4.0%)\n8 (3.1%)\n\n\n    Married\n\n202 (49%)\n89 (59%)\n113 (43%)\n\n\n    Single\n\n180 (44%)\n48 (32%)\n132 (51%)\n\n\n    Widowed\n\n14 (3.4%)\n7 (4.7%)\n7 (2.7%)\n\n\nParticipant's Locality\n410\n\n\n\n\n\n    AbuHamad\n\n52 (13%)\n15 (10%)\n37 (14%)\n\n\n    Atbara\n\n110 (27%)\n42 (28%)\n68 (26%)\n\n\n    Barbar\n\n8 (2.0%)\n4 (2.7%)\n4 (1.5%)\n\n\n    Eldamer\n\n123 (30%)\n47 (31%)\n76 (29%)\n\n\n    Elmatama\n\n46 (11%)\n23 (15%)\n23 (8.8%)\n\n\n    Shendi\n\n71 (17%)\n19 (13%)\n52 (20%)\n\n\n\n\n1\nn (%); Median (IQR)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Income Distribution Before and After Conflict Among IDPs and Host Community\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Sankey plot showing the displacement patterns of IDPs to the State\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.3: Descriptive Statistics of Participants’ Socioeconomic Characteristics\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive Statistics of Socio-economic Information Stratified by Displacement status\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nN\n\nOverall, N = 410\n1\n\n\nHost community member, N = 150\n1\n\n\nIDP, N = 260\n1\n\n\np-value\n2\n\n\n\n\nEducation level\n410\n\n\n\n&lt;0.001\n\n\n    Illiterate\n\n4 (1.0%)\n4 (2.7%)\n0 (0%)\n\n\n\n    khalwa\n\n3 (0.7%)\n1 (0.7%)\n2 (0.8%)\n\n\n\n    Primary\n\n50 (12%)\n31 (21%)\n19 (7.3%)\n\n\n\n    Secondary\n\n87 (21%)\n37 (25%)\n50 (19%)\n\n\n\n    University\n\n185 (45%)\n60 (40%)\n125 (48%)\n\n\n\n    Post-graduate\n\n81 (20%)\n17 (11%)\n64 (25%)\n\n\n\nOccupation before the armed conflict\n410\n\n\n\n0.11\n\n\n    Labouror (nonprofessional)\n\n82 (20%)\n36 (24%)\n46 (18%)\n\n\n\n    Others\n\n13 (3.2%)\n7 (4.7%)\n6 (2.3%)\n\n\n\n    Professional Employee\n\n168 (41%)\n54 (36%)\n114 (44%)\n\n\n\n    Retired\n\n2 (0.5%)\n0 (0%)\n2 (0.8%)\n\n\n\n    Searching for job\n\n4 (1.0%)\n0 (0%)\n4 (1.5%)\n\n\n\n    Unemployed\n\n141 (34%)\n53 (35%)\n88 (34%)\n\n\n\nOccupation after the armed conflict\n410\n\n\n\n&lt;0.001\n\n\n    Labouror (nonprofessional)\n\n97 (24%)\n33 (22%)\n64 (25%)\n\n\n\n    Others\n\n15 (3.7%)\n7 (4.7%)\n8 (3.1%)\n\n\n\n    Professional Employee\n\n103 (25%)\n53 (35%)\n50 (19%)\n\n\n\n    Retired\n\n3 (0.7%)\n0 (0%)\n3 (1.2%)\n\n\n\n    Searching for job\n\n30 (7.3%)\n4 (2.7%)\n26 (10%)\n\n\n\n    Unemployed\n\n162 (40%)\n53 (35%)\n109 (42%)\n\n\n\nType of Shelter\n410\n\n\n\n&lt;0.001\n\n\n    Host Communities\n\n124 (30%)\n16 (11%)\n108 (42%)\n\n\n\n    Owned\n\n197 (48%)\n123 (82%)\n74 (28%)\n\n\n\n    Rented Accommodation\n\n64 (16%)\n8 (5.3%)\n56 (22%)\n\n\n\n    Schools or Other Public Buildings\n\n25 (6.1%)\n3 (2.0%)\n22 (8.5%)\n\n\n\nHousing conditions\n410\n\n\n\n&lt;0.001\n\n\n    Good\n\n144 (35%)\n72 (48%)\n72 (28%)\n\n\n\n    Acceptable\n\n213 (52%)\n69 (46%)\n144 (55%)\n\n\n\n    Bad\n\n53 (13%)\n9 (6.0%)\n44 (17%)\n\n\n\nAverage monthly income before the conflict (1000 SDG)\n287\n160 (100, 250)\n120 (86, 200)\n200 (120, 300)\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nAverage monthly income after the conflict (1000 SDG)\n247\n120 (75, 200)\n120 (75, 243)\n120 (73, 200)\n0.4\n\n\nIncome satisfaction for family needs\n409\n65 (16%)\n31 (21%)\n34 (13%)\n0.062\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nn (%); Median (IQR)\n\n\n\n\n2\nPearson’s Chi-squared test (simulation if expected counts &lt; 5); Wilcoxon rank sum test; Fisher’s exact test",

    "text": "5.2 Social Cohesion among IDPs and Host Communities\nSocial Integration and Participation of IDP Communities Towards Host Communities\nThe survey assessed the social integration and participation of internally displaced persons (IDPs) within the host community, focusing on friendships, feelings of acceptance, social activity engagement, experiences of kindness, comfort in seeking help, and overall social integration as shown in Table 5.4\nFriendships: Among the 260 IDPs surveyed, 47% reported having a few friends, 40% had many friends, and 13% had no friends within the host community.\nAcceptance: Of 256 respondents, 59% always felt welcomed, 34% sometimes felt welcomed, and 7% never felt welcomed by the host community.\nSocial Activity Engagement: Engagement was high, with 47% of 252 respondents always participating, 37% sometimes participating, and 16% never participating in social activities.\nExperiences of Kindness: Among the 258 respondents, 53% sometimes experienced kindness, 28% always experienced it, and 18% never did.\nComfort in Seeking Help: Comfort levels varied, with 45% of 254 respondents sometimes comfortable, 26% always comfortable, and 29% never comfortable seeking help from the host community.\nOverall Social Integration: None of the 259 respondents had low integration scores; 69% had average scores, while 31% had high scores\nShared Values and Goals Between IDPs and Host Community\nTable 5.5 describes the levels of shared values and goals between host community members and internally displaced persons (IDPs), highlighting cultural Alignment, Mutual Respect, Collaboration, and Shared Responsibility\nShared Cultural Values: Of 406 respondents, 12% reported never sharing cultural values, 52% sometimes shared values, and 36% always did. There was no significant difference between host community members and IDPs (p = .4).\nMutual Respect for Customs and Traditions: Among 401 respondents, 5% never experienced mutual respect, 35% sometimes experienced it, and 60% always did. The patterns were similar for both groups (p = .3).\nCollaboration to Solve Community Issues: From 396 responses, 20% never collaborated, 39% sometimes collaborated, and 41% always collaborated. The response distribution was consistent between the two groups (p = .5).\nFeeling of Shared Responsibility for Community Improvement: Out of 403 respondents, 19% never felt shared responsibility, 30% sometimes felt it, and 50% always felt it. There was a trend towards more host community members (55%) always feeling shared responsibility compared to IDPs (48%), but this was not statistically significant (p = .060).\nOverall Shared Values Score: The shared values score, categorized into low, average, or high, showed 22% of respondents with low scores, 64% with average scores, and 14% with high scores. The distribution was similar between host community members and IDPs (p &gt; .9).\n\n\n\nTable 5.4: Social Integration and Participation of IDPs Towards Host Community\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Integration and Participation of IDPs Towards Host Community\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nN\n\nN = 410\n1\n\n\n\n\nFriends from host community\n260\n\n\n\n    Never\n\n35 (13%)\n\n\n    Few\n\n121 (47%)\n\n\n    Many\n\n104 (40%)\n\n\nFeeling welcomed and accepted\n256\n\n\n\n    Never\n\n18 (7.0%)\n\n\n    Sometimes\n\n88 (34%)\n\n\n    Always\n\n150 (59%)\n\n\nEngagement in social activities\n252\n\n\n\n    Never\n\n41 (16%)\n\n\n    Sometimes\n\n93 (37%)\n\n\n    Always\n\n118 (47%)\n\n\nExperience of acts of kindness or assistance\n258\n\n\n\n    Never\n\n47 (18%)\n\n\n    Sometimes\n\n138 (53%)\n\n\n    Always\n\n73 (28%)\n\n\nComfort seeking help or support\n254\n\n\n\n    Never\n\n74 (29%)\n\n\n    Sometimes\n\n115 (45%)\n\n\n    Always\n\n65 (26%)\n\n\nSocial integration & participation score\n259\n\n\n\n    Low\n\n0 (0%)\n\n\n    Average\n\n178 (69%)\n\n\n    High\n\n81 (31%)\n\n\n\n\n1\nn (%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.5: Shared Values and Goals Information Stratified by Displacement status\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive Statistics of Shared Values & Goals Information Stratified by Displacement status\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nN\n\nOverall, N = 410\n1\n\n\nHost community member, N = 150\n1\n\n\nIDP, N = 260\n1\n\n\np-value\n2\n\n\n\n\nShared cultural values\n406\n\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n    Never\n\n49 (12%)\n15 (10%)\n34 (13%)\n\n\n\n    Sometimes\n\n211 (52%)\n84 (56%)\n127 (49%)\n\n\n\n    Always\n\n146 (36%)\n50 (34%)\n96 (37%)\n\n\n\nMutual respect for customs and traditions\n401\n\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n    Never\n\n20 (5.0%)\n4 (2.7%)\n16 (6.3%)\n\n\n\n    Sometimes\n\n140 (35%)\n54 (36%)\n86 (34%)\n\n\n\n    Always\n\n241 (60%)\n90 (61%)\n151 (60%)\n\n\n\nCollaboration to solve community issues and challenges\n396\n\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n    Never\n\n78 (20%)\n28 (19%)\n50 (20%)\n\n\n\n    Sometimes\n\n156 (39%)\n52 (36%)\n104 (41%)\n\n\n\n    Always\n\n162 (41%)\n64 (44%)\n98 (39%)\n\n\n\nPerceived Shared responsibility for improving the community\n403\n\n\n\n0.060\n\n\n    Never\n\n78 (19%)\n32 (22%)\n46 (18%)\n\n\n\n    Sometimes\n\n122 (30%)\n34 (23%)\n88 (34%)\n\n\n\n    Always\n\n203 (50%)\n81 (55%)\n122 (48%)\n\n\n\nShared values & goals score\n407\n\n\n\n&gt;0.9\n\n\n    Low\n\n88 (22%)\n33 (22%)\n55 (21%)\n\n\n\n    Average\n\n262 (64%)\n96 (64%)\n166 (65%)\n\n\n\n    High\n\n57 (14%)\n21 (14%)\n36 (14%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nn (%)\n\n\n\n\n2\nPearson’s Chi-squared test (simulation if expected counts &lt; 5); Wilcoxon rank sum test; Fisher’s exact test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevels of Perceived Equity and Justice in IDPs and Host Communities\nThe levels of perceived equity and justice of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and host community members, this was assessed in terms of their access to services, participation in decision-making, experiences of discrimination, and support from organizations, for more details see Table 5.6.\nEqual Access to Basic Services Among the 410 respondents, 93% agreed or strongly agreed that there should be equal access to basic services. Responses were similar between host community members and IDPs (p = .5).\nInclusiveness in Decision-Making Processes There was a significant difference (p = .008) regarding inclusiveness in community decision-making. A higher proportion of IDPs (59%) agreed that decision-making processes were inclusive compared to host community members (43%). Conversely, 26% of host community members disagreed, compared to 15% of IDPs.\nPrevalence of Discrimination Based on Status Perceived discrimination based on displacement status differed significantly (p &lt; .001). While 44% of participants disagreed or strongly disagreed with experiencing discrimination, IDPs were more likely to disagree (41%) compared to host community members (31%).\nEquitable Support from Humanitarian Organizations and Government Policies Responses were similar between the groups regarding equitable support (p = .6). A total of 62% disagreed or strongly disagreed that support should be equitable, with 64% of IDPs and 60% of host community members holding this view.\nEqual Employment and Economic Opportunities Perceptions of equal employment and economic opportunities did not differ significantly (p = .4). Overall, 65% agreed or strongly agreed that opportunities should be equal, with 66% of IDPs and 67% of host community members expressing this view.\nEqual Rights and Legal Protections Both groups showed similar perceptions of equal rights and legal protections (p = .2). Most participants agreed or strongly agreed (96%), with slightly higher agreement among host community members (98%) compared to IDPs (94%).\nOverall Perceived Equality and Justice Score The scores were categorized into low, average, or high. Of the 410 respondents, 62% had an average score, 24% had a high score, and 14% had a low score. The distribution was similar between host community members and IDPs, with no significant difference (p = .2).\nLevels of Perceived of Social Cohesion of IDPs and Host Communities\nWhen querying about the perceived (subjective) levels of social cohesion among host community members and internally displaced persons (IDPs), focusing on current cohesion levels and perceived changes over time as presented in Table 5.7 in more details.\nPerceived Level of Social Cohesion: Among the 410 respondents, 12% reported low social cohesion, 60% reported acceptable cohesion, and 28% reported high cohesion. The distribution of responses was similar between host community members and IDPs, with no significant difference (p = .6). Specifically, 11% of host community members and 12% of IDPs reported low cohesion, while 59% of host community members and 62% of IDPs reported acceptable cohesion. High cohesion was reported by 31% of host community members and 26% of IDPs.\nImprovement in Social Cohesion Over Time: Out of 410 respondents, 15% felt that social cohesion was regressing, 30% saw no difference or were unsure, and 55% believed it was improving. Host community members were more optimistic, with 62% reporting improvement compared to 52% of IDPs. Conversely, 13% of host community members and 17% of IDPs felt cohesion was regressing. These differences, however, were not statistically significant (p = .12).\n\n\n\nTable 5.6: Perceived Equity and Justice Information Stratified by Displacement status\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive Statistics of Perceived Equity and Justice Information Stratified by Displacement status\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nN\n\nOverall, N = 410\n1\n\n\nHost community member, N = 150\n1\n\n\nIDP, N = 260\n1\n\n\np-value\n2\n\n\n\n\nEqual access to basic services\n410\n\n\n\n0.5\n\n\n    Strongly Disagree\n\n7 (1.7%)\n4 (2.7%)\n3 (1.2%)\n\n\n\n    Disagree\n\n23 (5.6%)\n8 (5.3%)\n15 (5.8%)\n\n\n\n    Agree\n\n176 (43%)\n59 (39%)\n117 (45%)\n\n\n\n    Strongly Agree\n\n204 (50%)\n79 (53%)\n125 (48%)\n\n\n\nInclusiveness of decision-making processes\n410\n\n\n\n0.008\n\n\n    Strongly disagree\n\n24 (5.9%)\n12 (8.0%)\n12 (4.6%)\n\n\n\n    disagree\n\n79 (19%)\n39 (26%)\n40 (15%)\n\n\n\n    Agree\n\n218 (53%)\n65 (43%)\n153 (59%)\n\n\n\n    Strongly agree\n\n89 (22%)\n34 (23%)\n55 (21%)\n\n\n\nPrevalence of discrimination based on displacement\n410\n\n\n\n&lt;0.001\n\n\n    Strongly disagree\n\n47 (11%)\n15 (10%)\n32 (12%)\n\n\n\n    disagree\n\n134 (33%)\n32 (21%)\n102 (39%)\n\n\n\n    Agree\n\n182 (44%)\n77 (51%)\n105 (40%)\n\n\n\n    Strongly agree\n\n47 (11%)\n26 (17%)\n21 (8.1%)\n\n\n\nEquitable support and assistance from humanitarian organizations and government\n410\n\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n    Strongly disagree\n\n74 (18%)\n23 (15%)\n51 (20%)\n\n\n\n    disagree\n\n181 (44%)\n67 (45%)\n114 (44%)\n\n\n\n    Agree\n\n109 (27%)\n40 (27%)\n69 (27%)\n\n\n\n    Strongly agree\n\n46 (11%)\n20 (13%)\n26 (10%)\n\n\n\nEqual employment and economic opportunities\n410\n\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n    Strongly disagree\n\n27 (6.6%)\n11 (7.3%)\n16 (6.2%)\n\n\n\n    disagree\n\n116 (28%)\n39 (26%)\n77 (30%)\n\n\n\n    Agree\n\n180 (44%)\n62 (41%)\n118 (45%)\n\n\n\n    Strongly agree\n\n87 (21%)\n38 (25%)\n49 (19%)\n\n\n\nEqual rights and legal protections\n410\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Strongly disagree\n\n0 (0%)\n0 (0%)\n0 (0%)\n\n\n\n    disagree\n\n19 (4.6%)\n3 (2.0%)\n16 (6.2%)\n\n\n\n    Agree\n\n175 (43%)\n58 (39%)\n117 (45%)\n\n\n\n    Strongly agree\n\n216 (53%)\n89 (59%)\n127 (49%)\n\n\n\nPerceived equality & justice score\n410\n\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n    Low\n\n57 (14%)\n15 (10%)\n42 (16%)\n\n\n\n    Average\n\n255 (62%)\n94 (63%)\n161 (62%)\n\n\n\n    High\n\n98 (24%)\n41 (27%)\n57 (22%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nn (%)\n\n\n\n\n2\nPearson’s Chi-squared test (simulation if expected counts &lt; 5); Wilcoxon rank sum test; Fisher’s exact test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.7: Perceived Level of Cohesion Stratified by Displacement status\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive Statistics of Perceived Level of Cohesion Information Stratified by Displacement status\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nN\n\nOverall, N = 410\n1\n\n\nHost community member, N = 150\n1\n\n\nIDP, N = 260\n1\n\n\np-value\n2\n\n\n\n\nPerceived Level of social cohesion\n410\n\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n    Low cohesion\n\n48 (12%)\n16 (11%)\n32 (12%)\n\n\n\n    Acceptable cohesion\n\n248 (60%)\n88 (59%)\n160 (62%)\n\n\n\n    High cohesion\n\n114 (28%)\n46 (31%)\n68 (26%)\n\n\n\nImprovement in social cohesion over time\n410\n\n\n\n0.12\n\n\n    Regressing\n\n62 (15%)\n19 (13%)\n43 (17%)\n\n\n\n    No difference/Unsure\n\n121 (30%)\n38 (25%)\n83 (32%)\n\n\n\n    Improving\n\n227 (55%)\n93 (62%)\n134 (52%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nn (%)\n\n\n\n\n2\nPearson’s Chi-squared test (simulation if expected counts &lt; 5); Wilcoxon rank sum test; Fisher’s exact test",

    "text": "5.3 Levels of Resilience Among IDPs Compared to Host Communities\nIn Table 5.8, the levels of resilience among host community members and internally displaced persons (IDPs), focusing on psychological well-being (psychological Resilience), social support (Social Resilience), economic resources (Economic Resilience), preparedness for environmental challenges (Environmental Resilience), and overall resilience scores.\nPsychological Resilience by asking the degree of psychological well-being and coping mechanisms: Among 410 respondents, 26% reported low psychological well-being, 57% reported moderate levels, and 17% reported high levels. IDPs tended to report lower psychological well-being compared to host community members (p &lt; .001), with 29% of IDPs reporting low levels versus 20% of host community members.\nSocial Resilience through availability and effectiveness of social support networks: Responses indicated that 48% perceived social support networks as poor, 40% as acceptable, and 12% as good, with no significant difference between IDPs and host community members (p = .7).\nEconomic resilience asking about the current economic resources and livelihood opportunities: Participants reported weak economic resources (50%), moderate resources (42%), and strong resources (8%).

    "text": "5.6 Associations Between Variables and Social Cohesion and Resilience\nAssociations Between Various Variables and Levels of Perceived Social Cohesion\nWhen testing the associations between various variables and the perceived level of cohesion using bivariate analyses as presented in Table 5.11, we found the following:\nSignificant Associations:\n\nAge: There is a significant association between age and perceived level of social cohesion (p &lt; .001). Younger individuals tend to report lower cohesion, with median ages of 29 for low cohesion, 30 for acceptable cohesion, and 37 for high cohesion.\nMarital Status: shows a significant association (p = .007) with social cohesion. Single individuals are more likely to report lower cohesion (56%) compared to married individuals (33%) and divorced individuals (6.3%).\nParticipant’s Locality: The locality of participants significantly influences social cohesion (p &lt; .001). For example, participants from Atbara report higher acceptable cohesion (50%) compared to those from AbuHamad (2.1%).\nEducation Level: it shows a significant association (p = .049) with social cohesion. Illiterate individuals report lower cohesion (2.1%) compared to university-educated individuals (44%).\nOccupation After the Armed Conflict: There is a significant association (p = .023) between occupation after the armed conflict and social cohesion. Laborers report lower cohesion (19%) compared to professional employees (33%).\nType of Shelter: Type of shelter significantly influences social cohesion (p &lt; .001). Individuals in rented accommodations report lower cohesion (23%) compared to those in owned homes (33%).\nDuration of Residence in Host Community: Duration of residence shows a significant association (p &lt; .001) with social cohesion. Longer durations are associated with higher levels of cohesion (median of 12 months for high cohesion).\nPrevalence of Discrimination Based on IDP or Host Community Status: There is a significant association (p &lt; .001) between perceived discrimination and social cohesion. Those who strongly agree with discrimination tend to report lower cohesion (8.3%) compared to those who strongly disagree (31%).\nHealthcare Services: There is a strong link between healthcare accessibility and social cohesion (p &lt; 0.001). Those who find healthcare easily accessible tend to report higher cohesion (21%) compared to those with low (10%) and acceptable (17%) cohesion. On the other hand, individuals who find healthcare difficult to access are more likely to report low (42%) and high (46%) cohesion compared to acceptable (23%).\nEducation Opportunities: Education accessibility also shows a significant association with social cohesion (p = 0.005). Respondents who perceive education as easily accessible report higher cohesion (34%) compared to those with low (19%) and acceptable (29%) cohesion. Conversely, those who find education difficult to access are more likely to report high (36%) and low (29%) cohesion compared to acceptable (23%).\n\nNon-Significant Associations:\n\nDemographic Factors: Gender does not show a significant association with social cohesion (p = .4).\nDisplacement and Economic Factors: Displacement status, average monthly income before and after conflict, number of times displaced, and previous displacement or residence in another host community do not significantly associate with social cohesion (all p &gt; 0.05).\nInfrastructure: The accessibility of infrastructure, such as roads, electricity, and water supply, does not significantly affect perceived social cohesion (p = 0.5). The responses are fairly consistent across different cohesion levels, with most people finding infrastructure moderately accessible.\n\nAssociations Roles of Governments and other bodies in Relation to Percieved Social Cohesion\nThe Table 5.12 presents the associations between the cohesion and degree of interventions of different parties to improved it, we found:\n\n\nRole of Government Institutions and Authorities:\n\nThe perception of the role of government institutions is significantly associated with the level of social cohesion among respondents (p = 0.008). Specifically; respondents who perceive government institutions as supportive are more likely to report low (19%) and acceptable (17%) cohesion compared to high cohesion (11%).\n\n\n\nRole of Religious Leaders:\n\nAmong those reporting low social cohesion, 44% perceived no role from religious leaders, compared to 38% in the acceptable cohesion group and 41% in the high cohesion group. Supportive roles from religious leaders showed a significant association (p = 0.017) with higher social cohesion levels.\n\n\n\nRole of Tribal Sheiks:\n\nFor those with low social cohesion, 60% reported no role from tribal sheiks, compared to 44% in the acceptable cohesion group and 65% in the high cohesion group. Supportive roles from tribal sheiks were significantly associated (p = 0.017) with higher social cohesion.\n\n\n\nSupport from NGOs:\n\nNo significant associations were found between support from NGOs and social cohesion levels (p = 0.2).\n\n\n\nRole of Youth Engagement:\n\nOpposition to youth engagement was higher among those with low social cohesion (8.3%) compared to 1.6% in the acceptable cohesion group and none in the high cohesion group. Supportive roles from youth engagement were strongly associated (p &lt; 0.001) with higher social cohesion levels.\n\n\n\nCommunity Involvement (People Themselves):\n\nThose reporting low social cohesion had the highest proportion (21%) indicating opposition to community involvement, compared to 3.2% in the acceptable cohesion group and none in the high cohesion group. Strong support for community involvement showed a significant association (p &lt; 0.001) with higher social cohesion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.11: Factors Associated with Perceived Level of Social

between the different factors with social integration as presented in Table 5.13\nSignificant Associations:\n\nAge: shows a significant association (p &lt; .001) with social integration score. Older individuals tend to have higher integration scores, with a median age of 38 for high integration compared to 29 for average integration.\nMarital Status: demonstrates a significant association (p &lt; .001) with social integration score. Married individuals are more likely to have high integration scores (57%) compared to single individuals (37%).\nParticipant’s Locality: shows a significant association (p &lt; .001) with social integration score. For example, Eldamer residents are more likely to have high integration scores (41%) compared to Atbara residents (9.9%).\nEducation Level: exhibits a significant association (p &lt; .001) with social integration score. Post-graduate individuals have higher integration scores (33%) compared to those with primary education (9.9%).\nOccupation After the Armed Conflict: shows a significant association (p = .023) with social integration score. Laborers have lower integration scores (30%) compared to professional employees (17%).\nType of Shelter: it is significantly associated with social integration score (p &lt; .001). Individuals in rented accommodations have lower integration scores (6.2%) compared to those in owned homes (43%).\nDuration of Residence in Host Community: exhibits a significant association (p &lt; .001) with social integration score. Longer durations are associated with higher integration scores, with a median of 12 months for high integration.\n\nNon-Significant Associations:\n\nDemographic Factors: Gender does not show a significant association with social integration score (p = .4).\nEconomic Factors: Average monthly income before and after conflict, income satisfaction for family needs do not significantly associate with social integration score (all p &gt; 0.05).\nDisplacement and Other Factors: Number of times displaced, previous displacement or residence in another host community do not significantly associate with social integration score (all p &gt; 0.05).\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.13: Associations Between the Levels of Social Integration and Various Variables\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociations Between Different Factors with Social integration & participation score\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nN\n\nAverage, N = 178\n1\n\n\nHigh, N = 81\n1\n\n\np-value\n2\n\n\n\n\nGender\n259\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n    Female\n\n105 (59%)\n50 (62%)\n\n\n\n    Male\n\n73 (41%)\n31 (38%)\n\n\n\nAge\n259\n29 (24, 36)\n38 (28, 49)\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nMarital Status\n259\n\n\n0.006\n\n\n    Divorced\n\n6 (3.4%)\n1 (1.2%)\n\n\n\n    Married\n\n67 (38%)\n46 (57%)\n\n\n\n    Single\n\n102 (57%)\n30 (37%)\n\n\n\n    Widowed\n\n3 (1.7%)\n4 (4.9%)\n\n\n\nParticipant's Locality\n259\n\n\n&lt;0.001\n\n\n    AbuHamad\n\n19 (11%)\n18 (22%)\n\n\n\n    Atbara\n\n59 (33%)\n8 (9.9%)\n\n\n\n    Barbar\n\n2 (1.1%)\n2 (2.5%)\n\n\n\n    Eldamer\n\n43 (24%)\n33 (41%)\n\n\n\n    Elmatama\n\n14 (7.9%)\n9 (11%)\n\n\n\n    Shendi\n\n41 (23%)\n11 (14%)\n\n\n\nState of origin\n259\n\n\n0.060\n\n\n    Aj Jazirah\n\n20 (11%)\n3 (3.7%)\n\n\n\n    Khartoum\n\n147 (83%)\n67 (83%)\n\n\n\n    Red Sea\n\n1 (0.6%)\n1 (1.2%)\n\n\n\n    River Nile\n\n7 (3.9%)\n8 (9.9%)\n\n\n\n    Sennar\n\n1 (0.6%)\n2 (2.5%)\n\n\n\n    White Nile\n\n2 (1.1%)\n0 (0%)\n\n\n\nEducation level\n259\n\n\n\n\n\n    Illiterate\n\n0 (0%)\n0 (0%)\n\n\n\n    khalwa\n\n1 (0.6%)\n0 (0%)\n\n\n\n    Primary\n\n11 (6.2%)\n8 (9.9%)\n\n\n\n    Secondary\n\n32 (18%)\n18 (22%)\n\n\n\n    University\n\n97 (54%)\n28 (35%)\n\n\n\n    Post-graduate\n\n37 (21%)\n27 (33%)\n\n\n\nOccupation before the armed conflict\n259\n\n\n0.7\n\n\n    Labouror (nonprofessional)\n\n27 (15%)\n18 (22%)\n\n\n\n    Others\n\n4 (2.2%)\n2 (2.5%)\n\n\n\n    Professional Employee\n\n84 (47%)\n30 (37%)\n\n\n\n    Retired\n\n1 (0.6%)\n1 (1.2%)\n\n\n\n    Searching for job\n\n3 (1.7%)\n1 (1.2%)\n\n\n\n    Unemployed\n\n59 (33%)\n29 (36%)\n\n\n\nOccupation after the armed conflict\n259\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n    Labouror (nonprofessional)\n\n39 (22%)\n24 (30%)\n\n\n\n    Others\n\n5 (2.8%)\n3 (3.7%)\n\n\n\n    Professional Employee\n\n36 (20%)\n14 (17%)\n\n\n\n    Retired\n\n2 (1.1%)\n1 (1.2%)\n\n\n\n    Searching for job\n\n19 (11%)\n7 (8.6%)\n\n\n\n    Unemployed\n\n77 (43%)\n32 (40%)\n\n\n\nType of Shelter\n259\n\n\n&lt;0.001\n\n\n    Host Communities\n\n69 (39%)\n38 (47%)\n\n\n\n    Owned\n\n39 (22%)\n35 (43%)\n\n\n\n    Rented Accommodation\n\n51 (29%)\n5 (6.2%)\n\n\n\n    Schools or Other Public Buildings\n\n19 (11%)\n3 (3.7%)\n\n\n\nHousing conditions\n259\n\n\n0.001\n\n\n    Good\n\n40 (22%)\n31 (38%)\n\n\n\n    Acceptable\n\n99 (56%)\n45 (56%)\n\n\n\n    Bad\n\n39 (22%)\n5 (6.2%)\n\n\n\nAverage monthly income before the conflict (1000 SDG)\n179\n200 (120, 300)\n200 (120, 300)\n0.8\n\n\nAverage monthly income after the conflict (1000 SDG)\n139\n120 (75, 195)\n119 (70, 200)\n0.7\n\n\nIncome satisfaction for family needs\n258\n21 (12%)\n12 (15%)\n0.6\n\n\nNumber of times displaced\n80\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n    1\n\n8 (13%)\n2 (11%)\n\n\n\n    2\n\n38 (62%)\n11 (58%)\n\n\n\n    3\n\n13 (21%)\n4 (21%)\n\n\n\n    4\n\n2 (3.3%)\n0 (0%)\n\n\n\n    7\n\n0 (0%)\n1 (5.3%)\n\n\n\n    9\n\n0 (0%)\n1 (5.3%)\n\n\n\nPrevious displacement\n259\n61 (34%)\n19 (23%)\n0.11\n\n\nDuration of residence in the host community (months)\n259\n9 (5, 12)\n12 (10, 14)\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nPrevalence of discrimination based on displacement\n259\n\n\n0.046\n\n\n    Strongly disagree\n\n28 (16%)\n3 (3.7%)\n\n\n\n    disagree\n\n69 (39%)\n33 (41%)\n\n\n\n    Agree\n\n68 (38%)\n37 (46%)\n\n\n\n    Strongly agree\n\n13 (7.3%)\n8 (9.9%)\n\n\n\nAvailability and accessibility of healthcare services\n259\n\n\n0.012\n\n\n    Easily accessible\n\n27 (15%)\n7 (8.6%)\n\n\n\n    Moderately accessible\n\n104 (58%)\n38 (47%)\n\n\n\n    Difficult to access\n\n47 (26%)\n36 (44%)\n\n\n\nAvailability and accessibility of education opportunities\n259\n\n\n0.14\n\n\n    Easily accessible\n\n41 (23%)\n14 (17%)\n\n\n\n    Moderately accessible\n\n90 (51%)\n36 (44%)\n\n\n\n    Difficult to access\n\n47 (26%)\n31 (38%)\n\n\n\nAvailability and accessibility of infrastructure (roads, electricity, water supply)\n259\n\n\n0.7\n\n\n    Easily accessible\n\n18 (10%)\n10 (12%)\n\n\n\n    Moderately accessible\n\n87 (49%)\n42 (52%)\n\n\n\n    Difficult to access\n\n73 (41%)\n29 (36%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nn (%);

results presented in Table 5.15 highlights the relationships between level of Social Support and other factors\nSignificant Associations:\n\nAge: Age shows a significant association (p = 0.048) with social support score. Younger individuals tend to have higher social support scores (median 28) compared to older individuals (median 32).\nParticipant’s Locality: Locality demonstrates a significant association (p &lt; 0.001) with social support score. Individuals from Atbara are more likely to have high social support scores (42%) compared to those from AbuHamad (4.1%).\nOccupation After the Armed Conflict: Occupation after conflict shows a significant association (p &lt; 0.001) with social support score. Professional employees are more likely to have high social support scores (38%) compared to laborers (17%).\nType of Shelter: Type of shelter exhibits a significant association (p &lt; 0.001) with social support score. Individuals living in owned accommodations are more likely to have high social support scores (42%) compared to those in schools and other public buildings (13%)\nPrevious Displacement or Residence in Another Host Community: There is a significant association (p = 0.022) between previous displacement or residence in another host community and social support score. Individuals who have not experienced previous displacement are more likely to have high social support scores (46%) compared to those who have (29%).\nDuration of Residence in the Host Community: Duration of residence shows a significant association (p = 0.022) with social support score. Longer durations of residence are associated with lower social support scores, with a median of 7 months for high social support compared to 12 months for low social support.\nPrevalence of Discrimination Based on IDP or Host Community Status: Discrimination prevalence demonstrates a significant association (p &lt; 0.001) with social support score. Agreeing or strongly agreeing with discrimination based on IDP or host community status is associated with lower social support scores (29% and 20%, respectively) compared to disagreeing (32%) or strongly disagreeing (21%).\n\nNon-Significant Associations:\n\nGender: Gender does not show a significant association with social support score (p = 0.3).\nMarital Status: Marital status does not show a significant association with social support score (p = 0.7).\nDisplacement Status: Displacement status does not show a significant association with social support score (p = 0.2).\nEducation Level: Education level does not show a significant association with social support score (p = 0.8).\nOccupation Before the Armed Conflict: Occupation before conflict does not show a significant association with social support score (p = 0.062).\nAverage Monthly Income Before and After Conflict: Income-related factors (average monthly income before and after conflict, income satisfaction for family needs) do not show significant associations with social support score (all p &gt; 0.05).\nNumber of Times Displaced: Number of times displaced does not show a significant association with social support score (p = 0.2).\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.15: Associations Between the Levels of Social Support and Various Variables\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociations Between Different Factors with Perceived equality & justice score\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nN\n\nLow, N = 57\n1\n\n\nAverage, N = 255\n1\n\n\nHigh, N = 98\n1\n\n\np-value\n2\n\n\n\n\nGender\n410\n\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n    Female\n\n40 (70%)\n157 (62%)\n67 (68%)\n\n\n\n    Male\n\n17 (30%)\n98 (38%)\n31 (32%)\n\n\n\nAge\n410\n32 (25, 44)\n32 (26, 45)\n28 (24, 40)\n0.048\n\n\nMarital Status\n410\n\n\n\n0.7\n\n\n    Divorced\n\n3 (5.3%)\n8 (3.1%)\n3 (3.1%)\n\n\n\n    Married\n\n26 (46%)\n132 (52%)\n44 (45%)\n\n\n\n    Single\n\n25 (44%)\n109 (43%)\n46 (47%)\n\n\n\n    Widowed\n\n3 (5.3%)\n6 (2.4%)\n5 (5.1%)\n\n\n\nParticipant's Locality\n410\n\n\n\n&lt;0.001\n\n\n    AbuHamad\n\n10 (18%)\n38 (15%)\n4 (4.1%)\n\n\n\n    Atbara\n\n9 (16%)\n60 (24%)\n41 (42%)\n\n\n\n    Barbar\n\n0 (0%)\n5 (2.0%)\n3 (3.1%)\n\n\n\n    Eldamer\n\n16 (28%)\n84 (33%)\n23 (23%)\n\n\n\n    Elmatama\n\n5 (8.8%)\n24 (9.4%)\n17 (17%)\n\n\n\n    Shendi\n\n17 (30%)\n44 (17%)\n10 (10%)\n\n\n\nDisplacement status\n410\n\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n    Host community member\n\n15 (26%)\n94 (37%)\n41 (42%)\n\n\n\n    IDP\n\n42 (74%)\n161 (63%)\n57 (58%)\n\n\n\nEducation level\n410\n\n\n\n0.8\n\n\n    Illiterate\n\n0 (0%)\n3 (1.2%)\n1 (1.0%)\n\n\n\n    khalwa\n\n0 (0%)\n3 (1.2%)\n0 (0%)\n\n\n\n    Primary\n\n8 (14%)\n28 (11%)\n14 (14%)\n\n\n\n    Secondary\n\n14 (25%)\n52 (20%)\n21 (21%)\n\n\n\n    University\n\n24 (42%)\n113 (44%)\n48 (49%)\n\n\n\n    Post-graduate\n\n11 (19%)\n56 (22%)\n14 (14%)\n\n\n\nOccupation before the armed conflict\n410\n\n\n\n0.058\n\n\n    Labouror (nonprofessional)\n\n9 (16%)\n58 (23%)\n15 (15%)\n\n\n\n    Others\n\n0 (0%)\n6 (2.4%)\n7 (7.1%)\n\n\n\n    Professional Employee\n\n22 (39%)\n97 (38%)\n49 (50%)\n\n\n\n    Retired\n\n0 (0%)\n1 (0.4%)\n1 (1.0%)\n\n\n\n    Searching for job\n\n1 (1.8%)\n3 (1.2%)\n0 (0%)\n\n\n\n    Unemployed\n\n25 (44%)\n90 (35%)\n26 (27%)\n\n\n\nOccupation after the armed conflict\n410\n\n\n\n&lt;0.001\n\n\n    Labouror (nonprofessional)\n\n5 (8.8%)\n75 (29%)\n17 (17%)\n\n\n\n    Others\n\n0 (0%)\n9 (3.5%)\n6 (6.1%)\n\n\n\n    Professional Employee\n\n10 (18%)\n56 (22%)\n37 (38%)\n\n\n\n    Retired\n\n1 (1.8%)\n1 (0.4%)\n1 (1.0%)\n\n\n\n    Searching for job\n\n8 (14%)\n20 (7.8%)\n2 (2.0%)\n\n\n\n    Unemployed\n\n33 (58%)\n94 (37%)\n35 (36%)\n\n\n\nType of Shelter\n410\n\n\n\n&lt;0.001\n\n\n    Host Communities\n\n18 (32%)\n84 (33%)\n22 (22%)\n\n\n\n    Owned\n\n30 (53%)\n126 (49%)\n41 (42%)\n\n\n\n    Rented Accommodation\n\n3 (5.3%)\n39 (15%)\n22 (22%)\n\n\n\n    Schools or Other Public Buildings\n\n6 (11%)\n6 (2.4%)\n13 (13%)\n\n\n\nHousing conditions\n410\n\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n    Good\n\n18 (32%)\n89 (35%)\n37 (38%)\n\n\n\n    Acceptable\n\n28 (49%)\n136 (53%)\n49 (50%)\n\n\n\n    Bad\n\n11 (19%)\n30 (12%)\n12 (12%)\n\n\n\nAverage monthly income before the conflict (1000 SDG)\n287\n178 (99, 243)\n160 (100, 250)\n150 (90, 243)\n0.6\n\n\nAverage monthly income after the conflict (1000 SDG)\n247\n100 (60, 163)\n130 (90, 200)\n100 (60, 200)\n0.4\n\n\nIncome satisfaction for family needs\n409\n4 (7.0%)\n44 (17%)\n17 (17%)\n0.14\n\n\nNumber of times displaced\n80\n\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n    1\n\n2 (17%)\n6 (14%)\n2 (7.7%)\n\n\n\n    2\n\n7 (58%)\n27 (64%)\n15 (58%)\n\n\n\n    3\n\n1 (8.3%)\n7 (17%)\n9 (35%)\n\n\n\n    4\n\n1 (8.3%)\n1 (2.4%)\n0 (0%)\n\n\n\n    7\n\n1 (8.3%)\n0 (0%)\n0 (0%)\n\n\n\n    9\n\n0 (0%)\n1 (2.4%)\n0 (0%)\n\n\n\nPrevious displacement\n260\n12 (29%)\n42 (26%)\n26 (46%)\n0.022\n\n\nDuration of residence in the host community (months)\n260\n12 (5, 14)\n11 (7, 13)\n7 (2, 12)\n0.022\n\n\nPrevalence of discrimination based on displacement\n410\n\n\n\n&lt;0.001\n\n\n    Strongly disagree\n\n3 (5.3%)\n23 (9.0%)\n21 (21%)\n\n\n\n    disagree\n\n24 (42%)\n81 (32%)\n29 (30%)\n\n\n\n    Agree\n\n26 (46%)\n128 (50%)\n28 (29%)\n\n\n\n    Strongly agree\n\n4 (7.0%)\n23 (9.0%)\n20 (20%)\n\n\n\nAvailability and accessibility of healthcare services\n410\n\n\n\n0.004\n\n\n    Easily accessible\n\n5 (8.8%)\n47 (18%)\n20 (20%)\n\n\n\n    Moderately accessible\n\n22 (39%)\n131 (51%)\n55 (56%)\n\n\n\n    Difficult to access\n\n30 (53%)\n77 (30%)\n23 (23%)\n\n\n\nAvailability and accessibility of education opportunities\n410\n\n\n\n0.11\n\n\n    Easily accessible\n\n12 (21%)\n72 (28%)\n36 (37%)\n\n\n\n    Moderately accessible\n\n23 (40%)\n117 (46%)\n39 (40%)\n\n\n\n    Difficult to access\n\n22 (39%)\n66 (26%)\n23 (23%)\n\n\n\nAvailability and accessibility of infrastructure (roads, electricity, water supply)\n410\n\n\n\n0.075\n\n\n    Easily accessible\n\n4 (7.0%)\n38 (15%)\n12 (12%)\n\n\n\n    Moderately accessible\n\n36 (63%)\n125 (49%)\n41 (42%)\n\n\n\n    Difficult to access\n\n17 (30%)\n92 (36%)\n45 (46%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nn (%);

The median age was 36 years (IQR = 27, 46) for low resilience, 29 years (IQR = 25, 40) for average resilience, and 35 years (IQR = 26, 45) for high resilience.\nMarital Status: No significant association with resilience (p = 0.3).\nParticipant’s Locality: Locality was significantly associated with resilience levels (p &lt; 0.001). Individuals from Eldamer had the highest representation in the low resilience group (47%) and the average resilience group (24%), whereas those from Shendi had the highest representation in the high resilience group (26%).\nDisplacement Status: There was a significant association between displacement status and resilience levels (p &lt; 0.001). A majority of individuals with low resilience were IDPs (74%), while a higher proportion of host community members exhibited high resilience (57%).\nEducation Level: No significant association with resilience (p = 0.6).\nOccupation Before the Armed Conflict: No significant association with resilience (p = 0.7).\nOccupation After the Armed Conflict: significantly affected resilience levels (p = 0.008). Those with high resilience were more likely to be unemployed (46%) compared to those with low resilience (39%). Additionally, a smaller percentage of laborers exhibited high resilience (20%) compared to those with low resilience (36%).\nType of Shelter: Type of shelter significantly influenced resilience levels (p = 0.001). Individuals owning homes were more prevalent in the high resilience group (58%) compared to those with low resilience (29%). Conversely, those residing in public buildings were more common in the low resilience group (10%) than in the high resilience group (4.6%).\nHousing Conditions: Housing conditions were significantly associated with resilience levels (p &lt; 0.001). Distribution in the low resilience group was 29% with good conditions, 44% acceptable, and 27% bad. For average resilience, it was 33% good, 57% acceptable, and 9.4% bad. In the high resilience group, it was 51% good, 42% acceptable, and 7.7% bad.\nAverage Monthly Income Before and after the Conflict: they were not significantly associated with resilience levels (p = 0.074, p = 0.076 respectively).\nIncome Satisfaction for Family Needs: was significantly associated with resilience levels (p &lt; 0.001). In the low resilience group, 5.6% were satisfied, compared to 15% in the average resilience group and 34% in the high resilience group.\nNumber of Times Displaced: Number of times displaced was not significantly associated with resilience levels (p &gt; 0.9).\nPrevious Displacement: Previous displacement was not significantly associated with resilience levels (p = 0.2).\nDuration of Residence in the Host Community: Duration of residence was not significantly associated with resilience levels (p = 0.7).\nPrevalence of Discrimination Based on Displacement: Prevalence of discrimination was not significantly associated with resilience levels (p = 0.065).\nAvailability and Accessibility of basic Services:\nOverall, availability and accessibility attributes were significantly associated with resilience levels. Healthcare accessibility was notably linked to higher resilience scores, p&lt;.001; 37% of respondents with high resilience found healthcare easily accessible, compared to 15% with average resilience and 10% with low resilience. Conversely, 17% of those with high resilience reported difficult access to healthcare, versus 33% with average resilience and 38% with low resilience. Similarly, education accessibility was positively correlated with resilience, p = .003; 48% of high resilience respondents reported easy access to education, compared to 27% with average resilience and 21% with low resilience. Difficult access to education was reported by only 14% of high resilience individuals, compared to 28% with average resilience and 34% with low resilience. Infrastructure accessibility also significantly impacted resilience, p &lt;.001; 28% of those with high resilience found infrastructure easily accessible, compared to 12% with average resilience and 5.6% with low resilience. Difficulties in accessing infrastructure were reported by 18% of high resilience respondents, compared to 38% with average resilience and 49% with low resilience.\nRoles of Governments and other bodies in Relation with Resilience\nThe Table 5.17 presents the associations between the degree of overall resilience and degree of interventions of different parties to improved it, we found:\n\nRole of Government Institutions and Authorities: There was a significant association (p = 0.032) between supportive roles from government institutions and higher resilience scores. Those who reported high resilience scores were more likely to perceive supportive roles from government institutions (23%), compared to 16% in the average group and 6.7% in the low resilience group.\nRole of Religious Leaders: Supportive roles from religious leaders were significantly associated (p &lt; 0.001) with higher resilience scores. Participants with high resilience scores showed a higher proportion (78%) perceiving supportive roles from religious leaders, compared to 55% in the average group and none in the low resilience group.\nRole of Tribal Sheiks: There was a significant association (p = 0.049) between supportive roles from tribal sheiks and higher resilience scores. Supportive roles from tribal sheiks were more prevalent among those with high resilience scores (68%), compared to 43% in the average group and none in the low resilience group.\nSupport from NGOs: Although not statistically significant (p = 0.069), supportive roles from NGOs were more commonly perceived among those with high resilience scores (35%), compared to 29% in the average group and 0.8% in the low resilience group.\nRole of Youth Engagement: There was no significant association (p = 0.2) between roles of youth engagement and resilience scores.\n\nCommunity Involvement (People Themselves): High levels of community involvement were strongly associated (p &lt; 0.001) with higher resilience scores, with 91% of those reporting high resilience scores indicating supportive community involvement. This was compared to 64% in the average group and 6.7% in the low resilience group.\n\n\n\nTable 5.16: Associations Between the Levels of Resilience and Various Variables\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociations Between Different Factors with Overall resilience score\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nN\n\nLow, N = 90\n1\n\n\nAverage, N = 255\n1\n\n\nHigh, N = 65\n1\n\n\np-value\n2\n\n\n\n\nGender\n410\n\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n    Female\n\n54 (60%)\n163 (64%)\n47 (72%)\n\n\n\n    Male\n\n36 (40%)\n92 (36%)\n18 (28%)\n\n\n\nAge\n410\n36 (27, 46)\n29 (25, 40)\n35 (26, 45)\n0.029\n\n\nMarital Status\n410\n\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n    Divorced\n\n2 (2.2%)\n10 (3.9%)\n2 (3.1%)\n\n\n\n    Married\n\n45 (50%)\n118 (46%)\n39 (60%)\n\n\n\n    Single\n\n38 (42%)\n121 (47%)\n21 (32%)\n\n\n\n    Widowed\n\n5 (5.6%)\n6 (2.4%)\n3 (4.6%)\n\n\n\nParticipant's Locality\n410\n\n\n\n&lt;0.001\n\n\n    AbuHamad\n\n3 (3.3%)\n44 (17%)\n5 (7.7%)\n\n\n\n    Atbara\n\n31 (34%)\n63 (25%)\n16 (25%)\n\n\n\n    Barbar\n\n1 (1.1%)\n6 (2.4%)\n1 (1.5%)\n\n\n\n    Eldamer\n\n42 (47%)\n62 (24%)\n19 (29%)\n\n\n\n    Elmatama\n\n7 (7.8%)\n32 (13%)\n7 (11%)\n\n\n\n    Shendi\n\n6 (6.7%)\n48 (19%)\n17 (26%)\n\n\n\nDisplacement status\n410\n\n\n\n&lt;0.001\n\n\n    Host community member\n\n23 (26%)\n90 (35%)\n37 (57%)\n\n\n\n    IDP\n\n67 (74%)\n165 (65%)\n28 (43%)\n\n\n\nEducation level\n410\n\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n    Illiterate\n\n0 (0%)\n3 (1.2%)\n1 (1.5%)\n\n\n\n    khalwa\n\n0 (0%)\n2 (0.8%)\n1 (1.5%)\n\n\n\n    Primary\n\n11 (12%)\n30 (12%)\n9 (14%)\n\n\n\n    Secondary\n\n21 (23%)\n47 (18%)\n19 (29%)\n\n\n\n    University\n\n37 (41%)\n124 (49%)\n24 (37%)\n\n\n\n    Post-graduate\n\n21 (23%)\n49 (19%)\n11 (17%)\n\n\n\nOccupation before the armed conflict\n410\n\n\n\n0.7\n\n\n    Labouror (nonprofessional)\n\n19 (21%)\n53 (21%)\n10 (15%)\n\n\n\n    Others\n\n3 (3.3%)\n9 (3.5%)\n1 (1.5%)\n\n\n\n    Professional Employee\n\n38 (42%)\n104 (41%)\n26 (40%)\n\n\n\n    Retired\n\n0 (0%)\n1 (0.4%)\n1 (1.5%)\n\n\n\n    Searching for job\n\n0 (0%)\n4 (1.6%)\n0 (0%)\n\n\n\n    Unemployed\n\n30 (33%)\n84 (33%)\n27 (42%)\n\n\n\nOccupation after the armed conflict\n410\n\n\n\n0.008\n\n\n    Labouror (nonprofessional)\n\n32 (36%)\n52 (20%)\n13 (20%)\n\n\n\n    Others\n\n4 (4.4%)\n10 (3.9%)\n1 (1.5%)\n\n\n\n    Professional Employee\n\n18 (20%)\n66 (26%)\n19 (29%)\n\n\n\n    Retired\n\n0 (0%)\n2 (0.8%)\n1 (1.5%)\n\n\n\n    Searching for job\n\n1 (1.1%)\n28 (11%)\n1 (1.5%)\n\n\n\n    Unemployed\n\n35 (39%)\n97 (38%)\n30 (46%)\n\n\n\nType of Shelter\n410\n\n\n\n0.001\n\n\n    Host Communities\n\n31 (34%)\n76 (30%)\n17 (26%)\n\n\n\n    Owned\n\n26 (29%)\n133 (52%)\n38 (58%)\n\n\n\n    Rented Accommodation\n\n24 (27%)\n33 (13%)\n7 (11%)\n\n\n\n    Schools or Other Public Buildings\n\n9 (10%)\n13 (5.1%)\n3 (4.6%)\n\n\n\nHousing conditions\n410\n\n\n\n&lt;0.001\n\n\n    Good\n\n26 (29%)\n85 (33%)\n33 (51%)\n\n\n\n    Acceptable\n\n40 (44%)\n146 (57%)\n27 (42%)\n\n\n\n    Bad\n\n24 (27%)\n24 (9.4%)\n5 (7.7%)\n\n\n\nAverage monthly income before the conflict (1000 SDG)\n287\n200 (110, 375)\n150 (100, 243)\n157 (100, 200)\n0.074\n\n\nAverage monthly income after the conflict (1000 SDG)\n247\n120 (55, 180)\n120 (70, 200)\n150 (100, 230)\n0.076\n\n\nIncome satisfaction for family needs\n409\n5 (5.6%)\n38 (15%)\n22 (34%)\n&lt;0.001\n\n\nNumber of times displaced\n80\n\n\n\n&gt;0.9\n\n\n    1\n\n2 (12%)\n7 (12%)\n1 (17%)\n\n\n\n    2\n\n10 (59%)\n35 (61%)\n4 (67%)\n\n\n\n    3\n\n5 (29%)\n11 (19%)\n1 (17%)\n\n\n\n    4\n\n0 (0%)\n2 (3.5%)\n0 (0%)\n\n\n\n    7\n\n0 (0%)\n1 (1.8%)\n0 (0%)\n\n\n\n    9\n\n0 (0%)\n1 (1.8%)\n0 (0%)\n\n\n\nPrevious displacement\n260\n17 (25%)\n57 (35%)\n6 (21%)\n0.2\n\n\nDuration of residence in the host community (months)\n260\n11 (7, 13)\n11 (5, 13)\n11 (6, 13)\n0.7\n\n\nPrevalence of discrimination based on displacement\n410\n\n\n\n0.065\n\n\n    Strongly disagree\n\n8 (8.9%)\n32 (13%)\n7 (11%)\n\n\n\n    disagree\n\n30 (33%)\n90 (35%)\n14 (22%)\n\n\n\n    Agree\n\n47 (52%)\n103 (40%)\n32 (49%)\n\n\n\n    Strongly agree\n\n5 (5.6%)\n30 (12%)\n12 (18%)\n\n\n\nAvailability and accessibility of healthcare services\n410\n\n\n\n&lt;0.001\n\n\n    Easily accessible\n\n9 (10%)\n39 (15%)\n24 (37%)\n\n\n\n    Moderately accessible\n\n47 (52%)\n131 (51%)\n30 (46%)\n\n\n\n    Difficult to access\n\n34 (38%)\n85 (33%)\n11 (17%)\n\n\n\nAvailability and accessibility of education opportunities\n410\n\n\n\n0.003\n\n\n    Easily accessible\n\n19 (21%)\n70 (27%)\n31 (48%)\n\n\n\n    Moderately accessible\n\n40 (44%)\n114 (45%)\n25 (38%)\n\n\n\n    Difficult to access\n\n31 (34%)\n71 (28%)\n9 (14%)\n\n\n\nAvailability and accessibility of infrastructure (roads, electricity, water supply)\n410\n\n\n\n&lt;0.001\n\n\n    Easily accessible\n\n5 (5.6%)\n31 (12%)\n18 (28%)\n\n\n\n    Moderately accessible\n\n41 (46%)\n126 (49%)\n35 (54%)\n\n\n\n    Difficult to access\n\n44 (49%)\n98 (38%)\n12 (18%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nn (%);

No significant overall difference (p = 0.3).\nPhysical Health Status: Ratings were evenly spread from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent), with no significant differences between host community members and IDPs (p = 0.4).\nRelationships with Family: Host community members rated their family relationships higher (67%) compared to IDPs (45%) (p &lt; 0.001), indicating better relationships among host community members.\nRelationships with Friends: Host community members reported more positive friendships (43%) than IDPs (22%) (p &lt; 0.001), showing stronger friendships among host community members.\nWorry about Global Events: IDPs (42%) were slightly more worried than host community members (38%), but the difference was not significant (p = 0.038).\nOptimism about the Next 12 Months: Host community members were more optimistic (58%) compared to IDPs (42%) (p = 0.027), indicating higher optimism among host community members.\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.18: Descriptive Statistics of Dimensions of Health Information Stratified by Displacement status\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptive Statistics of Dimensions of Health Information Stratified by Displacement status\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nN\n\nOverall, N = 410\n1\n\n\nHost community member, N = 150\n1\n\n\nIDP, N = 260\n1\n\n\np-value\n2\n\n\n\n\nHealth status (last 6 months)\n410\n\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n    Bad\n\n88 (21%)\n26 (17%)\n62 (24%)\n\n\n\n    Fairly good\n\n176 (43%)\n67 (45%)\n109 (42%)\n\n\n\n    Good\n\n146 (36%)\n57 (38%)\n89 (34%)\n\n\n\nPhysical health status\n410\n\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n    1\n\n26 (6.3%)\n5 (3.3%)\n21 (8.1%)\n\n\n\n    2\n\n47 (11%)\n19 (13%)\n28 (11%)\n\n\n\n    3\n\n158 (39%)\n58 (39%)\n100 (38%)\n\n\n\n    4\n\n115 (28%)\n42 (28%)\n73 (28%)\n\n\n\n    5\n\n64 (16%)\n26 (17%)\n38 (15%)\n\n\n\nRelationships with family\n410\n\n\n\n&lt;0.001\n\n\n    1\n\n10 (2.4%)\n2 (1.3%)\n8 (3.1%)\n\n\n\n    2\n\n19 (4.6%)\n5 (3.3%)\n14 (5.4%)\n\n\n\n    3\n\n63 (15%)\n14 (9.3%)\n49 (19%)\n\n\n\n    4\n\n100 (24%)\n29 (19%)\n71 (27%)\n\n\n\n    5\n\n218 (53%)\n100 (67%)\n118 (45%)\n\n\n\nRelationships with friends\n410\n\n\n\n&lt;0.001\n\n\n    1\n\n30 (7.3%)\n8 (5.3%)\n22 (8.5%)\n\n\n\n    2\n\n67 (16%)\n19 (13%)\n48 (18%)\n\n\n\n    3\n\n110 (27%)\n27 (18%)\n83 (32%)\n\n\n\n    4\n\n82 (20%)\n32 (21%)\n50 (19%)\n\n\n\n    5\n\n121 (30%)\n64 (43%)\n57 (22%)\n\n\n\nWorry about global events\n410\n\n\n\n0.038\n\n\n    1\n\n39 (9.5%)\n12 (8.0%)\n27 (10%)\n\n\n\n    2\n\n22 (5.4%)\n12 (8.0%)\n10 (3.8%)\n\n\n\n    3\n\n112 (27%)\n45 (30%)\n67 (26%)\n\n\n\n    4\n\n76 (19%)\n18 (12%)\n58 (22%)\n\n\n\n    5\n\n161 (39%)\n63 (42%)\n98 (38%)\n\n\n\nOptimism about the next 12 months\n410\n\n\n\n0.027\n\n\n    1\n\n71 (17%)\n16 (11%)\n55 (21%)\n\n\n\n    2\n\n77 (19%)\n25 (17%)\n52 (20%)\n\n\n\n    3\n\n77 (19%)\n33 (22%)\n44 (17%)\n\n\n\n    4\n\n60 (15%)\n21 (14%)\n39 (15%)\n\n\n\n    5\n\n125 (30%)\n55 (37%)\n70 (27%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nn (%)\n\n\n\n\n2\nPearson’s Chi-squared test (simulation if expected counts &lt; 5); Wilcoxon rank sum test; Fisher’s exact test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociations Between Wellbeing Attributes with Perceived Levels of social cohesion\nThe associations between various wellbeing attributes and perceived levels of social cohesion are summarized in Table 5.19 and Table 5.20. Below are the detailed findings for each attribute:\nHealth Status (last 6 months): There was no significant association between health status and perceived levels of social cohesion (p = 0.3).\nPhysical Health Status: There was no significant association found (p = 0.10).\nRelationships with Family: This attribute also showed no significant association (p = 0.12).\nRelationships with Friends: The association between relationships with friends and social cohesion was significant (p = 0.002). Low cohesion groups had fewer positive ratings (23% as best) compared to high cohesion groups (31% as best), suggesting better relationships correlate with higher cohesion.\nWorry about Global Events: There was no significant association (p = 0.079).\nOptimism about the Next 12 Months: Optimism about the next 12 months was significantly associated with social cohesion (p = 0.047). In low cohesion groups, 31% were most optimistic, compared to 40% in high cohesion groups, indicating higher optimism correlates with better social cohesion.\n\n\n\nTable 5.19: Associations Between Wellbeing Attributes with Perceived Levels of social cohesion\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociations Between Different Factors with Perceived Level of social cohesion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nN\n\nLow cohesion, N = 48\n1\n\n\nAcceptable cohesion, N = 248\n1\n\n\nHigh cohesion, N = 114\n1\n\n\np-value\n2\n\n\n\n\nHealth status (last 6 months)\n410\n\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n    Bad\n\n8 (17%)\n50 (20%)\n30 (26%)\n\n\n\n    Fairly good\n\n23 (48%)\n113 (46%)\n40 (35%)\n\n\n\n    Good\n\n17 (35%)\n85 (34%)\n44 (39%)\n\n\n\nPhysical health status\n410\n\n\n\n0.10\n\n\n    1\n\n1 (2.1%)\n15 (6.0%)\n10 (8.8%)\n\n\n\n    2\n\n10 (21%)\n27 (11%)\n10 (8.8%)\n\n\n\n    3\n\n20 (42%)\n98 (40%)\n40 (35%)\n\n\n\n    4\n\n7 (15%)\n75 (30%)\n33 (29%)\n\n\n\n    5\n\n10 (21%)\n33 (13%)\n21 (18%)\n\n\n\nRelationships with family\n410\n\n\n\n0.11\n\n\n    1\n\n0 (0%)\n7 (2.8%)\n3 (2.6%)\n\n\n\n    2\n\n4 (8.3%)\n9 (3.6%)\n6 (5.3%)\n\n\n\n    3\n\n9 (19%)\n38 (15%)\n16 (14%)\n\n\n\n    4\n\n12 (25%)\n71 (29%)\n17 (15%)\n\n\n\n    5\n\n23 (48%)\n123 (50%)\n72 (63%)\n\n\n\nRelationships with friends\n410\n\n\n\n0.003\n\n\n    1\n\n6 (13%)\n19 (7.7%)\n5 (4.4%)\n\n\n\n    2\n\n9 (19%)\n47 (19%)\n11 (9.6%)\n\n\n\n    3\n\n14 (29%)\n71 (29%)\n25 (22%)\n\n\n\n    4\n\n8 (17%)\n36 (15%)\n38 (33%)\n\n\n\n    5\n\n11 (23%)\n75 (30%)\n35 (31%)\n\n\n\nWorry about global events\n410\n\n\n\n0.082\n\n\n    1\n\n4 (8.3%)\n17 (6.9%)\n18 (16%)\n\n\n\n    2\n\n2 (4.2%)\n12 (4.8%)\n8 (7.0%)\n\n\n\n    3\n\n10 (21%)\n69 (28%)\n33 (29%)\n\n\n\n    4\n\n8 (17%)\n54 (22%)\n14 (12%)\n\n\n\n    5\n\n24 (50%)\n96 (39%)\n41 (36%)\n\n\n\nOptimism about the next 12 months\n410\n\n\n\n0.047\n\n\n    1\n\n13 (27%)\n41 (17%)\n17 (15%)\n\n\n\n    2\n\n9 (19%)\n53 (21%)\n15 (13%)\n\n\n\n    3\n\n8 (17%)\n52 (21%)\n17 (15%)\n\n\n\n    4\n\n3 (6.3%)\n38 (15%)\n19 (17%)\n\n\n\n    5\n\n15 (31%)\n64 (26%)\n46 (40%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nn (%)\n\n\n\n\n2\nPearson’s Chi-squared test (simulation if expected counts &lt; 5); Wilcoxon rank sum test; Fisher’s exact test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.20: P_values for Associations Between Well-Being Attributes and Perceived Levels of Social Cohesion and Resilience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribute\nSocial Cohesion (p-value)\nResilience (p-value)\n\n\n\nHealth Status\n0.3\n&lt; 0.001\n\n\nPhysical Health Status\n0.10\n&lt; 0.001\n\n\nRelationships with Family\n0.12\n0.004\n\n\nRelationships with Friends\n0.002\n&lt; 0.001\n\n\nWorry about Global Events\n0.079\n&lt; 0.001\n\n\nOptimism about the Next 12 Months\n0.047\n&lt; 0.001\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociations Between Wellbeing Attributes with Levels of Resilience\nThe associations between various wellbeing attributes and levels of resilience are summarized in Table 5.21 the detailed findings for each attribute:\n\nHealth Status (last 6 months): Significant association with resilience (p &lt; 0.001).

    "text": "6.1 Socio-economic Characteristics\nWe have included in our study a total of 410 participants, including 260 (61%) IDPs and 150 (39%) host community members. Taken from 6 localities, as Eldamer had the highest overall representation (30%), followed by Atbara (27%) and Shendi (17%). Then least localities with AbuHamad, Elmatama, and Barbar by (13%, 11%, & 2%) respectively.\nThere are obvious discrepancies in socio-demographic characteristics between the IDPs and host communities. The study population had a median age of 31 years (IQR: 25-43), with a gender distribution of 64% females and 36% males. Marital status varied, with 29% single, 56% married, and 15% divorced or widowed. Our study revealed significant socio-economic differences between IDPs and host community members. As, educational levels significantly differed, with more IDPs having university (48% vs. 40%) and post-graduate education (25% vs. 11%) (p &lt; .001), which could give more opportunities for the host community for development. Occupation post-conflict showed a significant shift (p &lt; .001), with professional employment decreasing among IDPs (from 44% to 19%) and unemployment rising (42% vs. 34%). We observed there is significant discrepancies in type of shelter among IDPs and host members (p &lt; .001), with IDPs more frequently lived in host communities and rented accommodations (62%) while host community members, who predominantly owned homes (82%). This even superimposed by Housing conditions, with fewer IDPs reporting good conditions (28% vs. 48%) (p &lt; .001). Median monthly income before the conflict was higher for IDPs (Mdn = 200) than for host community members (Mdn = 120) (p &lt; .001), but post-conflict income levels showed no significant difference (p = .4), this indicates the drop in earnings due to loss of employment and it appears in low income satisfaction, among both parties with no significant difference (p = .062) as shown in Figure 5.1 & Table 5.3 . Also, we observed the displacement pattern of displaced persons from various states due to conflict, the analysis reveals that people tends to displace to the proximity safe area as evident by coming from surrounding states (Khartoum, Aj Jazerah and River Nile)",

    "section": "6.2 Social Cohesion among IDPs and Host Communities",
    "text": "6.2 Social Cohesion among IDPs and Host Communities\n\nSocial Integration and Participation of IDP Communities Towards Host Communities\nThe survey assessed the social integration and participation of internally displaced persons (IDPs) within the host community, focusing on friendships, acceptance, social activity engagement, experiences of kindness, comfort in seeking help, and overall social integration Table 5.4. Our study showed all of IDPs have average to high social integration into host community (100%), These findings resonate with Chuiko & Fedorenko’s (2020) study, which found that the majority of IDPs exhibited medium to high levels of social integration within host communities (87.1%)(Chuiko & Fedorenko, 2021).\nThis is supported by high friendships of IDPs from host community, majority felt accepted by the host community, with moderate social activity engagement, high experiences of kindness, and comfort in seeking help; which is emphasized by the literature that importance of factors influencing integration include friendships, feelings of acceptance, and participation in social activities (Roshchyk et al., 2024). The findings also align with Hynie’s 2018, discussion on barriers to refugee integration, pointing out that while challenges exist, active engagement and positive experiences within the host community contribute significantly to IDP integration (Hynie, 2018). Tassang et al in 2023, highlighted solidarity among IDPs as crucial for promoting psychological health and community satisfaction, aspects that correlate with the high levels of acceptance and experiences of kindness reported here (Tassang et al., 2023). Overall, these insights underscore the multifaceted nature of social integration among IDPs, highlighting both challenges and opportunities for fostering inclusive communities.\n\n\nShared Values & Goals Between the IDPs & Host Community\nThe levels of shared values and goals between host community members and internally displaced persons (IDPs), highlighting cultural alignment, mutual respect, collaboration, and shared responsibility Table 5.5. Overall, the shared values and goals revealed that majority of respondents had medium to high levels (78%), with a similar distribution between host community members and IDPs (p &gt; .9). Majority reported medium to high levels of mutual cultural values (87%), with no significant difference between host community members and IDPs (p = .4). Almost majority of respondents have mutual respect for customs and traditions in addition to their collaboration to solve community issues, with similar patterns for both groups (p = .3, .5 respectively). Although there was a trend towards more host community members (55%) always feeling shared responsibility for community improvement compared to IDPs (48%), this was not statistically significant (p = .060). This is similar to findings with Hazizova (2019) that emphasized the need to address socio-cultural needs to prevent conflicts, which resonates with the high levels of mutual respect and collaboration observed in this study (Hazizova, 2019). Additionally, Duncan (2005) study found high levels of collaboration and shared responsibility (Duncan, 2005). Overall, the findings suggest a strong foundation of shared values and goals between IDPs and host community members, supporting successful integration and social cohesion.\n\n\nLevels of Perceived Equity and Justice in IDPs and Host Communities\nAs the findings indicated a high level of consensus between IDPs and host community members regarding the need for equal access to basic services, employment opportunities, and legal protections, Table 5.6. As evidenced by the high agreement rates and non-significant p-values (e.g., p = .5 for access to services, p = .4 for employment opportunities, and p = .2 for legal protections). However, significant differences exist in perceptions of inclusiveness in decision-making (p = .008) and experiences of discrimination (p &lt; .001). Specifically, 59% of IDPs found decision-making processes inclusive compared to 43% of host community members, and IDPs were less likely to perceive discrimination (41% disagreed) compared to host community members (31% disagreed). Comparatively, existing literature supports these findings by Jacobs et al. (2017) and Orach et al. (2009) emphasize the varied justice mechanisms and barriers to services faced by IDPs, indicating the need for tailored approaches to address these challenges (Jacobs, 2017; Orach et al., 2009)\n\n\nLevel of Perceived of Social Cohesion of IDPs and Host Communities\nThe survey examined the perceived levels of social cohesion among host community members and internally displaced persons (IDPs), focusing on current perceptions and changes over time Table 5.7. Majority of respondents reported acceptable to high cohesion (60% and 28%). Interestingly, the distribution of responses did not significantly differ between host community members and IDPs (p = .6). Regarding changes over time, half of the respondents believed that social cohesion (55%) was improving. Host community members were more optimistic, with 62% reporting improvement compared to 52% of IDPs; however, were not statistically significant (p = .12). These findings align with existing research on social cohesion in forced displacement contexts as (Kuhnt et al., 2019) found similar levels of acceptable and high cohesion among displaced populations.\n\n\nLevels of Resilience Among IDPs Compared to Host Communities\nExamining the levels of resilience among host community members and internally displaced persons (IDPs), focusing on psychological well-being, social support, economic resources, preparedness for environmental challenges, and overall resilience scores Table 5.8.\nThe overall resilience levels showed 62% had an average score, and 16% had a high score. IDPs were significantly more likely to have a low resilience score compared to host community members (p &lt; .001). Notably, IDPs tended to report lower psychological well-being compared to host community members (p &lt; .001), with 29% of IDPs reporting low levels versus 20% of host community members.\nRegarding social resilience, both groups agreed on the social support networks as poor or acceptable (48%, 40%) (p = .7). Similarly, about economic resilience as weak or moderate (42%, 50%) (p = .4). However, IDPs were less likely to feel well-prepared for environmental challenges compared to host community members (p &lt; .001), with 33% of IDPs reporting poor preparedness versus 22% of host community members.",

Healthcare services accessibility emerges as a critical issue, IDPs perceive healthcare services as less accessible than host community members. This finding aligns with previous research (Orach et al., 2013; Parwak, 2019), which identifies barriers such as financial constraints and inadequate availability of essential medications and trained personnel.\nSimilarly, education opportunities for IDPs face significant challenges, as indicated by our findings and supported by literature (Ekezie et al., 2020; Orach et al., 2013) . Factors such as disrupted schooling, financial limitations, and geographic distance to educational facilities pose substantial barriers.\nIn contrast, we did not find significant differences between IDPs and host communities regarding infrastructure accessibility (roads, electricity, water supply). This contrasts with findings from other contexts (Parwak, 2019), where conflict-induced infrastructure damage and limited maintenance impede basic service accessibility.",

Perceptions of minimal government involvement underscore systemic issues in governance and service delivery, necessitating policy reforms to enhance institutional support and responsiveness to displaced populations. NGO involvement also emerges as a critical factor, with our study and existing literature Ekezie et al., 2020, highlighting challenges in NGO service delivery due to logistical constraints and funding limitations (Ekezie et al., 2020).\nCommunity involvement and support mechanisms play a pivotal role in fostering resilience among IDPs and host communities alike. The findings suggest positive community engagement, echoing resilience-building strategies identified in previous studies (Horn, 2009). However, variations in support from different community actors (youth, religious leaders) underscore the need for targeted engagement strategies that harness local resources and capacities.",

    "section": "6.5 Associations Between Variables & Social Cohesion and Resilience",
    "text": "6.5 Associations Between Variables & Social Cohesion and Resilience\n\nAssociations Between Various Variables and Perceived Levels of Social Cohesion\nBased on our findings, several significant associations for social cohesion among internally displaced persons (IDPs) and host communities emerge Table 5.11. These findings are crucial for understanding the dynamics that influence social cohesion in conflict-affected regions.\nOlder age, marriage, higher educational status are notably associated with higher perceived social cohesion, with younger individuals, single and illiterates tending to report lower cohesion levels. This resonates with the study by Hauwa ,2023, that suggests age-related differences, social networks and family structures & educational opportunities may impact social integration and community resilience efforts, highlighting a potential focus area for targeted interventions (Butu et al., 2023).\nOccupation after conflict and type of shelter are also associated with social cohesion, with laborers and individuals in rented accommodations reporting lower cohesion levels. This association highlights economic stability and housing security as essential factors in shaping perceptions of community cohesion and well-being, in contrast, economic strain is negatively associated with perceptions of social cohesion in European countries (Andrews et al., 2014). Also, highlighted by the study in disaster-affected communities, that factors such as housing type, injury experience, and volunteering were significantly linked to community disaster resilience and social cohesion (Ludin et al., 2018).\nDuration of residence in the host community significantly influences social cohesion, with longer-term residents reporting higher cohesion levels. This aligns with finding that extended periods in host communities foster familiarity, trust, and participation in social activities among IDPs (Lin et al., 2016). This finding underscores the importance of stability and continuity in fostering trust and solidarity within communities facing displacement challenges (Butu et al., 2023). Perceptions of discrimination based on IDP or host community status strongly influence social cohesion, with higher reported discrimination correlating with lower cohesion levels. Healthcare and education accessibility play significant roles in shaping social cohesion perceptions. Individuals who find healthcare and education easily accessible report higher cohesion levels, highlighting the critical role of accessible services in promoting community well-being and integration (Butu et al., 2023).\n\n\nAssociations Between Various Variables and Social Integration & Participation\nSocial integration among internally displaced persons (IDPs) is influenced by a range of demographic, socio-economic, and environmental factors, as evidenced by recent studies. Age, marital status, education level, occupation, type of shelter, and duration of residence in host communities emerge as significant determinants of social integration scores Table 5.13.\nOlder individuals, married individuals, and those with higher levels of education, such as post-graduate degrees, tend to have higher social integration scores, indicating that age, marital status, and educational attainment positively influence social integration among IDPs (Lin et al., 2016).\nThe locality of residence and occupation type significantly affect social integration, with Eldamer residents showing higher integration scores compared to Atbara residents, and professional employees demonstrating higher integration scores compared to laborers, indicating regional variations in community acceptance and the role of occupational status in socio-economic interactions among IDPs (Chuiko & Fedorenko, 2021).\nAdditionally, individuals living in owned homes report higher social integration scores compared to those in rented accommodations. This association highlights the stability and socio-economic security provided by home ownership, which contributes to stronger community ties and integration (Srivarathan et al., 2022). Longer durations of residence correlate positively with higher social integration scores, suggesting that extended periods in host communities foster familiarity, trust, and participation in social activities among IDPs (Lin et al., 2016). In contrast, gender does not significantly correlate with social integration scores among IDPs, indicating that integration levels are not substantially influenced by gender differences Similarly, economic factors such as average monthly income before and after conflict, as well as income satisfaction for family needs, do not show significant associations with social integration scores.\n\n\nAssociations Between Various Variables and Shared Values and Goals\nOur analysis of factors influencing shared values among internally displaced persons (IDPs) highlights significant associations with gender, age, marital status, locality of residence, education level, occupation, displacement history, duration of residence, and attitudes towards discrimination Table 5.14.\nMales are more likely to report higher shared values scores compared to females (51% vs. 49%, p = 0.039). Older individuals tend to endorse higher shared values (median age 37 vs. 27 for high vs. low shared values, p &lt; 0.001). Married individuals align more with community values than single individuals (67% vs. 30%, p = 0.013). Eldamer residents exhibit higher shared values scores compared to Atbara residents (58% vs. 7.0%, p &lt; 0.001). Post-graduate individuals report higher scores compared to those with primary education (35% vs. 11%, p = 0.027). Professional employees show higher shared values compared to laborers (37% vs. 18%, p = 0.019). Those who have not experienced displacement align more with community values (8.3% vs. 51%, p &lt; 0.001). Longer stays in the host community are associated with higher shared values (median of 12 months for high shared values, p &lt; 0.001). Agreement with discriminatory practices correlates with higher shared values (60% vs. 28%, p = 0.002). Non-significant associations include displacement status, type of shelter, and various economic indicators, suggesting socio-cultural and contextual factors play a more decisive role in shaping shared community values among IDPs. These findings resonate with existing research on the social determinants of health and well-being among displaced populations. Studies from Sudan and neighboring regions highlight the intricate interplay of socio-demographic factors, displacement experiences, and community integration. For instance, studies on mental health among IDPs in Sudan reveal how factors like gender, age, and socio-economic status influence psychological well-being (Joanna P. de Berry, 2018; Salah et al., 2012). The role of education in shaping attitudes towards gender norms in conflict-affected settings further underscores the broader socio-cultural dynamics influencing community values (Scott et al., 2014).\n\n\nAssociations between Different Factors and Levels of Social Support\nSocial support plays a crucial role in the mental health and adjustment of displaced persons as shown in Table 5.15. Studies have found that sociodemographic factors such as age, gender, education, income, and religiosity are associated with levels of social support among internally displaced persons (IDPs) and humanitarian migrants (Doma et al., 2022; Ngwu et al., 2023). The duration of displacement and experiences of discrimination can also impact social support levels (Ngwu et al., 2023). Higher levels of social support are linked to better mental health outcomes and adjustment to displacement (Chuiko & Fedorenko, 2021; Doma et al., 2022) . However, displacement can lead to changes in social and cultural norms, affecting overall health (Joanna P. de Berry, 2018). Response strategies used by IDPs include a combination of health services, traditional practices, religion, and support from family and friends (Joanna P. de Berry, 2018). These findings highlight the importance of addressing social determinants of health and tailoring support programs for displaced populations.\n\n\nAssociations between Different Factors and Levels of Resilience\nThe associations between various factors and resilience levels in the studied population reveal significant insights as detailed in Table 5.17. Gender was not significantly associated with resilience (p = 0.3), but a trend indicated that females might exhibit slightly higher resilience, with a higher proportion of females in the high resilience group. this different from Study by Mujeeb & Zubair (2012) that highlight the heightened vulnerability of IDPs, particularly women, to lower psychological well-being and resilience in comparison to non-displaced populations (Mujeeb & Zubair, 2012) . Age showed a significant association (p = 0.029), with younger individuals demonstrating higher resilience levels, highlighting developmental and contextual influences on resilience (Daníelsdóttir et al., 2022).\nMarital status was not significantly linked to resilience (p = 0.3), though married individuals were more prevalent in the high resilience group, suggesting potential social support benefits. Participant’s locality (p &lt; 0.001) and displacement status (p &lt; 0.001) were significantly associated with resilience, with IDPs showing lower resilience levels, underscoring the impact of displacement\nEducation level (p = 0.6) and occupation before conflict (p = 0.7) were not significantly associated with resilience. However, post-conflict occupation was significant (p = 0.009), with higher resilience linked to a higher percentage of unemployed individuals, indicating the crucial role of post-conflict economic stability. Type of shelter and housing conditions were significantly associated with resilience (p = 0.001 and p &lt; 0.001), linking better housing to higher resilience.\nSocio-economic factors, such as monthly income before and after the conflict, were not significantly associated with resilience (p = 0.074 and p = 0.076), although higher resilience was associated with slightly higher median incomes post-conflict. Income satisfaction for family needs was significantly associated with resilience (p &lt; 0.001), indicating that perceived financial sufficiency is crucial for resilience.\nDisplacement-related factors like the number of times displaced and previous displacement were not significantly associated with resilience (p &gt; 0.9 and p = 0.2), nor was the duration of residence in the host community (p = 0.7). These findings suggest other factors, such as community involvement, might be more critical for resilience (Eades, 2013).\nAccess to services showed significant associations with resilience. Healthcare availability and accessibility (p &lt; 0.001), education opportunities (p = 0.003), and infrastructure (p &lt; 0.001) were linked to higher resilience, emphasizing the role of accessible services in enhancing resilience (Okvat & Zautra, 2011).\nThe roles of government institutions (p = 0.032), religious leaders (p &lt; 0.001), and tribal sheiks (p = 0.049) were significantly associated with higher resilience, highlighting the importance of social support networks. Support from NGOs was not statistically significant (p = 0.069), but a trend suggested higher perceived support among individuals with high resilience. Community involvement had a strong association with resilience (p &lt; 0.001), underlining the importance of engagement in fostering resilience (Daníelsdóttir et al., 2022). Shodeinde & Otabor (2018) emphasized the role of NGOs in facilitating integration, despite challenges in high-risk regions, which echoes the supportive social environment observed in this study (Shodeinde & Otabor, 2018)",

    "text": "6.6 Well-Being Status of the Participants\nThe analysis reveals insights into the health status and well-being of IDPs compared to host community members. While physical health ratings were similar between IDPs and host community members, of fairly good level of health status. But the latter group reported significantly better social relationships and higher levels of optimism. These differences reveals significant health and well-being challenges in IDPs compared to host communities. Studies confirm this as the prevalence of physical illness, depression, and anxiety disorders is reportedly higher among IDPs compared to non-displaced populations (Kouadio et al., 2012).\n\nAssociations Between Wellbeing Attributes with Perceived Levels of social cohesion and Resilience\nThe analysis of the wellbeing attributes in relation to social cohesion and resilience reveals distinct patterns of association as shown in Table 5.20. Regarding social cohesion, not all wellbeing attributes showed significant impacts. Health status, physical health status, relationships with family, and worry about global events did not have significant associations. However, relationships with friends (p = 0.002) and optimism about the next 12 months (p = 0.047) were significantly associated with social cohesion, indicating that strong friendships and a positive outlook on the future contribute to a sense of social cohesion. These findings are consistent with existing literature, which highlights the importance of social capital (trust, community ties, and civic engagement) in health outcomes and subjective well-being. Social capital is linked to better physical health and well-being (Helliwell & Putnam, 2004; Nancy Ross, 2002; Ngamaba et al., 2017). The positive association between social cohesion and well-being is complex and context-dependent, influenced by various dimensions of social capital and resilience (d’Errico et al., 2017; Lanzi, 2011; Quinn et al., 2020).\nIn terms of resilience, the associations were more consistently significant. Health status (p &lt; 0.001), physical health status (p &lt; 0.001), relationships with family (p = 0.004), relationships with friends (p &lt; 0.001), worry about global events (p &lt; 0.001), and optimism about the next 12 months (p &lt; 0.001) all showed strong positive associations with resilience. This underscores the importance of both physical wellbeing and social connections in fostering resilience, while also suggesting that awareness and concern about global issues may enhance resilience through adaptive coping mechanisms. Overall, while only certain attributes were linked to social cohesion, a comprehensive range of wellbeing factors significantly influenced resilience, highlighting the multifaceted nature of resilience. Research indicates that higher resilience levels are associated with better health outcomes, quality of life, and lower healthcare utilization and expenditures (Färber & Rosendahl, 2018; Musich et al., 2022; Schrojenstein Lantman et al., 2017; Wells, 2009). Resilience is linked to perceived health, immune functioning, and positive mental health, particularly in older adults and those with chronic illness (Färber & Rosendahl, 2018; Stewart & Yuen, 2011).\n\n\n\n\nAndrews, R., Jilke, S., & Van de Walle, S.

IDPs generally exhibited lower resilience levels, which were associated with poorer housing conditions, lower income satisfaction, and more frequent displacement. Key factors such as type of shelter, availability of healthcare, education opportunities, and infrastructure significantly influenced resilience levels. Social cohesion was found to have a profound impact on the well-being of both groups, with higher levels of social cohesion linked to better mental health outcomes and increased community support.\nImportantly, the study highlighted the crucial role of various stakeholders, including government institutions, religious leaders, and tribal sheiks, in enhancing resilience. Support from these entities was significantly associated with higher resilience scores among IDPs.",
