<p>We have included in our study a total of 410 participants, including 260 (61%) IDPs and 150 (39%) host community members. Taken from 6 localities, as Eldamer had the highest overall representation (30%), followed by Atbara (27%) and Shendi (17%). Then least localities with AbuHamad, Elmatama, and Barbar by (13%, 11%, &amp; 2%) respectively.</p>
<p>There are obvious discrepancies in socio-demographic characteristics between the IDPs and host communities. The study population had a median age of 31 years (IQR: 25-43), with a gender distribution of 64% females and 36% males. Marital status varied, with 29% single, 56% married, and 15% divorced or widowed. Our study revealed significant socio-economic differences between IDPs and host community members. As, educational levels significantly differed, with more IDPs having university (48% vs.&nbsp;40%) and post-graduate education (25% vs.&nbsp;11%) (p &lt; .001), which could give more opportunities for the host community for development. Occupation post-conflict showed a significant shift (p &lt; .001), with professional employment decreasing among IDPs (from 44% to 19%) and unemployment rising (42% vs.&nbsp;34%). We observed there is significant discrepancies in type of shelter among IDPs and host members (p &lt; .001), with IDPs more frequently lived in host communities and rented accommodations (62%) while host community members, who predominantly owned homes (82%). This even superimposed by Housing conditions, with fewer IDPs reporting good conditions (28% vs.&nbsp;48%) (p &lt; .001). Median monthly income before the conflict was higher for IDPs (Mdn = 200) than for host community members (Mdn = 120) (p &lt; .001), but post-conflict income levels showed no significant difference (p = .4), this indicates the drop in earnings due to loss of employment and it appears in low income satisfaction, among both parties with no significant difference (p = .062) as shown in&nbsp;<a href="05-results.html#fig-income-plot" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;<span>5.1</span></a> &amp; <a href="05-results.html#tbl-descriptive-ses" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;<span>5.3</span></a> . Also, we observed the displacement pattern of displaced persons from various states due to conflict, the analysis reveals that people tends to displace to the proximity safe area as evident by coming from surrounding states&nbsp;(<strong>Khartoum, Aj Jazerah</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>River Nile</strong>)</p>

<p>The survey assessed the social integration and participation of internally displaced persons (IDPs) within the host community, focusing on friendships, acceptance, social activity engagement, experiences of kindness, comfort in seeking help, and overall social integration <a href="05-results.html#tbl-descriptive-social-integration" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;<span>5.4</span></a>. Our study showed all of IDPs have average to high social integration into host community (100%), These findings resonate with Chuiko &amp; Fedorenkoâ€™s (2020) study, which found that the majority of IDPs exhibited medium to high levels of social integration within host communities (87.1%)<span class="citation" data-cites="chuiko2021">(<a href="refs.html#ref-chuiko2021" role="doc-biblioref">Chuiko &amp; Fedorenko, 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This is supported by high friendships of IDPs from host community, majority felt accepted by the host community, with moderate social activity engagement, high experiences of kindness, and comfort in seeking help; which is emphasized by the literature that importance of factors influencing integration include friendships, feelings of acceptance, and participation in social activities <span class="citation" data-cites="roshchyk2024">(<a href="refs.html#ref-roshchyk2024" role="doc-biblioref">Roshchyk et al., 2024</a>)</span>. The findings also align with Hynieâ€™s 2018, discussion on barriers to refugee integration, pointing out that while challenges exist, active engagement and positive experiences within the host community contribute significantly to IDP integration <span class="citation" data-cites="hynie2018">(<a href="refs.html#ref-hynie2018" role="doc-biblioref">Hynie, 2018</a>)</span>. Tassang et al in 2023, highlighted solidarity among IDPs as crucial for promoting psychological health and community satisfaction, aspects that correlate with the high levels of acceptance and experiences of kindness reported here <span class="citation" data-cites="tassang2023a">(<a href="refs.html#ref-tassang2023a" role="doc-biblioref">Tassang et al., 2023</a>)</span>.

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="shared-values-goals-between-the-idps-host-community">Shared Values &amp; Goals Between the IDPs &amp; Host Community</h3>
<p>The levels of shared values and goals between host community members and internally displaced persons (IDPs), highlighting cultural alignment, mutual respect, collaboration, and shared responsibility <a href="05-results.html#tbl-shared-values-desc" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;<span>5.5</span></a>. Overall, the shared values and goals revealed that majority of respondents had medium to high levels (78%), with a similar distribution between host community members and IDPs (p &gt; .9). Majority reported medium to high levels of mutual cultural values (87%), with no significant difference between host community members and IDPs (p = .4). Almost majority of respondents have mutual respect for customs and traditions in addition to their collaboration to solve community issues, with similar patterns for both groups (p = .3, .5 respectively). Although there was a trend towards more host community members (55%) always feeling shared responsibility for community improvement compared to IDPs (48%), this was not statistically significant (p = .060). This is similar to findings with Hazizova (2019) that emphasized the need to address socio-cultural needs to prevent conflicts, which resonates with the high levels of mutual respect and collaboration observed in this study <span class="citation" data-cites="hazizova2019">(<a href="refs.html#ref-hazizova2019" role="doc-biblioref">Hazizova, 2019</a>)</span>. Additionally, Duncan (2005) study found high levels of collaboration and shared responsibility <span class="citation" data-cites="duncan2005">(<a href="refs.html#ref-duncan2005" role="doc-biblioref">Duncan, 2005</a>)</span>. Overall, the findings suggest a strong foundation of shared values and goals between IDPs and host community members, supporting successful integration and social cohesion.</p>

<p>As the findings indicated a high level of consensus between IDPs and host community members regarding the need for equal access to basic services, employment opportunities, and legal protections, <a href="05-results.html#tbl-social-support-desc" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;<span>5.6</span></a>. As evidenced by the high agreement rates and non-significant p-values (e.g., p = .5 for access to services, p = .4 for employment opportunities, and p = .2 for legal protections). However, significant differences exist in perceptions of inclusiveness in decision-making (p = .008) and experiences of discrimination (p &lt; .001). Specifically, 59% of IDPs found decision-making processes inclusive compared to 43% of host community members, and IDPs were less likely to perceive discrimination (41% disagreed) compared to host community members (31% disagreed). Comparatively, existing literature supports these findings by Jacobs et al.&nbsp;(2017) and Orach et al.&nbsp;(2009) emphasize the varied justice mechanisms and barriers to services faced by IDPs, indicating the need for tailored approaches to address these challenges <span class="citation" data-cites="orach2009 jacobs2017">(<a href="refs.html#ref-jacobs2017" role="doc-biblioref">Jacobs, 2017</a>; <a href="refs.html#ref-orach2009" role="doc-biblioref">Orach et al., 2009</a>)</span></p>

Majority of respondents reported acceptable to high cohesion (60% and 28%). Interestingly, the distribution of responses did not significantly differ between host community members and IDPs (p = .6). Regarding changes over time, half of the respondents believed that social cohesion (55%) was improving. Host community members were more optimistic, with 62% reporting improvement compared to 52% of IDPs; however, were not statistically significant (p = .12). These findings align with existing research on social cohesion in forced displacement contexts as <span class="citation" data-cites="kuhnt2019">(<a href="refs.html#ref-kuhnt2019" role="doc-biblioref">Kuhnt et al., 2019</a>)</span> found similar levels of acceptable and high cohesion among displaced populations.</p>

<p>The overall resilience levels showed 62% had an average score, and 16% had a high score. IDPs were significantly more likely to have a low resilience score compared to host community members (p &lt; .001). Notably, IDPs tended to report lower psychological well-being compared to host community members (p &lt; .001), with 29% of IDPs reporting low levels versus 20% of host community members.</p>
<p>Regarding social resilience, both groups agreed on the social support networks as poor or acceptable (48%, 40%) (p = .7). Similarly, about economic resilience as weak or moderate (42%, 50%) (p = .4). However, IDPs were less likely to feel well-prepared for environmental challenges compared to host community members (p &lt; .001), with 33% of IDPs reporting poor preparedness versus 22% of host community members.</p>

<p>The role of government institutions and authorities appears limited in both supporting and addressing the needs of IDPs <a href="05-results.html#tbl-roles-desc" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;<span>5.10</span></a>, as evidenced by our studyâ€™s findings and corroborated by literature <span class="citation" data-cites="verme2019 orach2013">(<a href="refs.html#ref-orach2013" role="doc-biblioref">Orach et al., 2013</a>; <a href="refs.html#ref-verme2019" role="doc-biblioref">Verme &amp; Schuettler, 2019</a>)</span>. Perceptions of minimal government involvement underscore systemic issues in governance and service delivery, necessitating policy reforms to enhance institutional support and responsiveness to displaced populations. NGO involvement also emerges as a critical factor, with our study and existing literature Ekezie et al., 2020<strong>,</strong> highlighting challenges in NGO service delivery due to logistical constraints and funding limitations <span class="citation" data-cites="Ekezie2020">(<a href="refs.html#ref-Ekezie2020" role="doc-biblioref">Ekezie et al., 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Community involvement and support mechanisms play a pivotal role in fostering resilience among IDPs and host communities alike.

<p>Based on our findings, several significant associations for social cohesion among internally displaced persons (IDPs) and host communities emerge <a href="05-results.html#tbl-social-cohesion-assoc" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;<span>5.11</span></a>. These findings are crucial for understanding the dynamics that influence social cohesion in conflict-affected regions.</p>
<p>Older age, marriage, higher educational status are notably associated with higher perceived social cohesion, with younger individuals, single and illiterates tending to report lower cohesion levels. This resonates with the study by Hauwa ,2023, that suggests age-related differences, social networks and family structures &amp; educational opportunities may impact social integration and community resilience efforts, highlighting a potential focus area for targeted interventions <span class="citation" data-cites="butu2023">(<a href="refs.html#ref-butu2023" role="doc-biblioref">Butu et al., 2023</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Occupation after conflict and type of shelter are also associated with social cohesion, with laborers and individuals in rented accommodations reporting lower cohesion levels. This association highlights economic stability and housing security as essential factors in shaping perceptions of community cohesion and well-being, in contrast, economic strain is negatively associated with perceptions of social cohesion in European countries <span class="citation" data-cites="andrews2014">(<a href="refs.html#ref-andrews2014" role="doc-biblioref">Andrews et al., 2014</a>)</span><strong>.</strong> Also, highlighted by the study in disaster-affected communities, that factors such as housing type, injury experience, and volunteering were significantly linked to community disaster resilience and social cohesion <span class="citation" data-cites="ludin2018">(<a href="refs.html#ref-ludin2018" role="doc-biblioref">Ludin et al., 2018</a>)</span><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Duration of residence in the host community significantly influences social cohesion, with longer-term residents reporting higher cohesion levels. This aligns with finding that extended periods in host communities foster familiarity, trust, and participation in social activities among IDPs <span class="citation" data-cites="lin2016">(<a href="refs.html#ref-lin2016" role="doc-biblioref">Lin et al., 2016</a>)</span>.

Perceptions of discrimination based on IDP or host community status strongly influence social cohesion, with higher reported discrimination correlating with lower cohesion levels. Healthcare and education accessibility play significant roles in shaping social cohesion perceptions. Individuals who find healthcare and education easily accessible report higher cohesion levels, highlighting the critical role of accessible services in promoting community well-being and integration <span class="citation" data-cites="butu2023">(<a href="refs.html#ref-butu2023" role="doc-biblioref">Butu et al., 2023</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Social integration among internally displaced persons (IDPs) is influenced by a range of demographic, socio-economic, and environmental factors, as evidenced by recent studies. Age, marital status, education level, occupation, type of shelter, and duration of residence in host communities emerge as significant determinants of social integration scores <a href="05-results.html#tbl-social-integ-assoc" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;<span>5.13</span></a>.</p>
<p>Older individuals, married individuals, and those with higher levels of education, such as post-graduate degrees, tend to have higher social integration scores, indicating that age, marital status, and educational attainment positively influence social integration among IDPs <span class="citation" data-cites="lin2016">(<a href="refs.html#ref-lin2016" role="doc-biblioref">Lin et al., 2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The locality of residence and occupation type significantly affect social integration, with Eldamer residents showing higher integration scores compared to Atbara residents, and professional employees demonstrating higher integration scores compared to laborers, indicating regional variations in community acceptance and the role of occupational status in socio-economic interactions among IDPs <span class="citation" data-cites="chuiko2021">(<a href="refs.html#ref-chuiko2021" role="doc-biblioref">Chuiko &amp; Fedorenko, 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Additionally, individuals living in owned homes report higher social integration scores compared to those in rented accommodations.

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="associations-between-various-variables-and-shared-values-and-goals">Associations Between Various Variables and Shared Values and Goals</h3>
<p>Our analysis of factors influencing shared values among internally displaced persons (IDPs) highlights significant associations with gender, age, marital status, locality of residence, education level, occupation, displacement history, duration of residence, and attitudes towards discrimination <a href="05-results.html#tbl-shared-values-assoc" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;<span>5.14</span></a>.</p>
<p>Males are more likely to report higher shared values scores compared to females (51% vs.&nbsp;49%, p = 0.039). Older individuals tend to endorse higher shared values (median age 37 vs.&nbsp;27 for high vs.&nbsp;low shared values, p &lt; 0.001). Married individuals align more with community values than single individuals (67% vs.&nbsp;30%, p = 0.013). Eldamer residents exhibit higher shared values scores compared to Atbara residents (58% vs.&nbsp;7.0%, p &lt; 0.001). Post-graduate individuals report higher scores compared to those with primary education (35% vs.&nbsp;11%, p = 0.027). Professional employees show higher shared values compared to laborers (37% vs.&nbsp;18%, p = 0.019). Those who have not experienced displacement align more with community values (8.3% vs.&nbsp;51%, p &lt; 0.001). Longer stays in the host community are associated with higher shared values (median of 12 months for high shared values, p &lt; 0.001). Agreement with discriminatory practices correlates with higher shared values (60% vs.&nbsp;28%, p = 0.002). Non-significant associations include displacement status, type of shelter, and various economic indicators, suggesting socio-cultural and contextual factors play a more decisive role in shaping shared community values among IDPs. These findings resonate with existing research on the social determinants of health and well-being among displaced populations. Studies from Sudan and neighboring regions highlight the intricate interplay of socio-demographic factors, displacement experiences, and community integration.

<p>Marital status was not significantly linked to resilience (p = 0.3), though married individuals were more prevalent in the high resilience group, suggesting potential social support benefits. Participantâ€™s locality (p &lt; 0.001) and displacement status (p &lt; 0.001) were significantly associated with resilience, with IDPs showing lower resilience levels, underscoring the impact of displacement</p>
<p>Education level (p = 0.6) and occupation before conflict (p = 0.7) were not significantly associated with resilience. However, post-conflict occupation was significant (p = 0.009), with higher resilience linked to a higher percentage of unemployed individuals, indicating the crucial role of post-conflict economic stability. Type of shelter and housing conditions were significantly associated with resilience (p = 0.001 and p &lt; 0.001), linking better housing to higher resilience.</p>
<p>Socio-economic factors, such as monthly income before and after the conflict, were not significantly associated with resilience (p = 0.074 and p = 0.076), although higher resilience was associated with slightly higher median incomes post-conflict. Income satisfaction for family needs was significantly associated with resilience (p &lt; 0.001), indicating that perceived financial sufficiency is crucial for resilience.</p>
<p>Displacement-related factors like the number of times displaced and previous displacement were not significantly associated with resilience (p &gt; 0.9 and p = 0.2), nor was the duration of residence in the host community (p = 0.7).

However, relationships with friends (p = 0.002) and optimism about the next 12 months (p = 0.047) were significantly associated with social cohesion, indicating that strong friendships and a positive outlook on the future contribute to a sense of social cohesion. These findings are consistent with existing literature, which highlights the importance of social capital (trust, community ties, and civic engagement) in health outcomes and subjective well-being. Social capital is linked to better physical health and well-being <span class="citation" data-cites="helliwell2004 ngamaba2017 ross2002">(<a href="refs.html#ref-helliwell2004" role="doc-biblioref">Helliwell &amp; Putnam, 2004</a>; <a href="refs.html#ref-ross2002" role="doc-biblioref">Nancy Ross, 2002</a>; <a href="refs.html#ref-ngamaba2017" role="doc-biblioref">Ngamaba et al., 2017</a>)</span><strong>.</strong> The positive association between social cohesion and well-being is complex and context-dependent, influenced by various dimensions of social capital and resilience <span class="citation" data-cites="lanzi2011 quinn2020 derrico2017">(<a href="refs.html#ref-derrico2017" role="doc-biblioref">dâ€™Errico et al., 2017</a>; <a href="refs.html#ref-lanzi2011" role="doc-biblioref">Lanzi, 2011</a>; <a href="refs.html#ref-quinn2020" role="doc-biblioref">Quinn et al., 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In terms of resilience, the associations were more consistently significant.

This underscores the importance of both physical wellbeing and social connections in fostering resilience, while also suggesting that awareness and concern about global issues may enhance resilience through adaptive coping mechanisms. Overall, while only certain attributes were linked to social cohesion, a comprehensive range of wellbeing factors significantly influenced resilience, highlighting the multifaceted nature of resilience.

<span id="cb1-24"><a href="#cb1-24" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>There are obvious discrepancies in socio-demographic characteristics between the IDPs and host communities. The study population had a median age of 31 years (IQR: 25-43), with a gender distribution of 64% females and 36% males. Marital status varied, with 29% single, 56% married, and 15% divorced or widowed. Our study revealed significant socio-economic differences between IDPs and host community members. As, educational levels significantly differed, with more IDPs having university (48% vs.&nbsp;40%) and post-graduate education (25% vs.&nbsp;11%) (p <span class="sc">\&lt;</span> .001), which could give more opportunities for the host community for development. Occupation post-conflict showed a significant shift (p <span class="sc">\&lt;</span> .001), with professional employment decreasing among IDPs (from 44% to 19%) and unemployment rising (42% vs.&nbsp;34%). We observed there is significant discrepancies in type of shelter among IDPs and host members (p <span class="sc">\&lt;</span> .001), with IDPs more frequently lived in host communities and rented accommodations (62%) while host community members, who predominantly owned homes (82%). This even superimposed by Housing conditions, with fewer IDPs reporting good conditions (28% vs.&nbsp;48%) (p <span class="sc">\&lt;</span> .001). Median monthly income before the conflict was higher for IDPs (Mdn = 200) than for host community members (Mdn = 120) (p <span class="sc">\&lt;</span> .001), but post-conflict income levels showed no significant difference (p = .4), this indicates the drop in earnings due to loss of employment and it appears in low income satisfaction, among both parties with no significant difference (p = .062) as shown in&nbsp;@fig-income-plot &amp; @tbl-descriptive-ses . Also, we observed the displacement pattern of displaced persons from various states due to conflict, the analysis reveals that people tends to displace to the proximity safe area as evident by coming from surrounding states&nbsp;(**Khartoum, Aj Jazerah**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**River Nile**)</span>

Our study showed all of IDPs have average to high social integration into host community (100%), These findings resonate with Chuiko &amp; Fedorenko's (2020) study, which found that the majority of IDPs exhibited medium to high levels of social integration within host communities (87.1%)<span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@chuiko2021</span><span class="co">]</span>.</span>

Studies confirm this as the prevalence of physical illness, depression, and anxiety disorders is reportedly higher among IDPs compared to non-displaced populations <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@Kouadio2012</span><span class="co">]</span>.</span>

<span id="cb1-124"><a href="#cb1-124" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The analysis of the wellbeing attributes in relation to social cohesion and resilience reveals distinct patterns of association as shown in @tbl-health-cohesion-resilience. Regarding social cohesion, not all wellbeing attributes showed significant impacts. Health status, physical health status, relationships with family, and worry about global events did not have significant associations. However, relationships with friends (p = 0.002) and optimism about the next 12 months (p = 0.047) were significantly associated with social cohesion, indicating that strong friendships and a positive outlook on the future contribute to a sense of social cohesion. These findings are consistent with existing literature, which highlights the importance of social capital (trust, community ties, and civic engagement) in health outcomes and subjective well-being. Social capital is linked to better physical health and well-being <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@helliwell2004; @ngamaba2017; @ross2002</span><span class="co">]</span>**.** The positive association between social cohesion and well-being is complex and context-dependent, influenced by various dimensions of social capital and resilience <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@lanzi2011; @quinn2020; @derrico2017</span><span class="co">]</span>.</span>

<span id="cb1-126"><a href="#cb1-126" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>In terms of resilience, the associations were more consistently significant. Health status (p <span class="sc">\&lt;</span> 0.001), physical health status (p <span class="sc">\&lt;</span> 0.001), relationships with family (p = 0.004), relationships with friends (p <span class="sc">\&lt;</span> 0.001), worry about global events (p <span class="sc">\&lt;</span> 0.001), and optimism about the next 12 months (p <span class="sc">\&lt;</span> 0.001) all showed strong positive associations with resilience. This underscores the importance of both physical wellbeing and social connections in fostering resilience, while also suggesting that awareness and concern about global issues may enhance resilience through adaptive coping mechanisms. Overall, while only certain attributes were linked to social cohesion, a comprehensive range of wellbeing factors significantly influenced resilience, highlighting the multifaceted nature of resilience. Research indicates that higher resilience levels are associated with better health outcomes, quality of life, and lower healthcare utilization and expenditures <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@vanschrojensteinlantman2017; @wells2009; @musich2022; @fÃ¤rber2018</span><span class="co">]</span>.
