We have included in our study a total of `r nrow(cleaned_data)` participants , including `r sum(cleaned_data$participant_status == "IDP")` (61%) IDPs and `r sum(cleaned_data$participant_status == "Host community member")` (39%) host community members. Taken from 6 localities, as Eldamer had the highest overall representation (30%), followed by Atbara (27%) and Shendi (17%). Then least localities with AbuHamad, Elmatama, and Barbar by (13%, 11%, and 2%) respectively.

After doing the normality testings using `Shapiro-Wilk tests` on our numerical variables. As shown in the @tbl-normality-testing, all of our variables are not normality distributed. So, we reported the univariate analysis results as `median (Mdn)and interquartile range (IQR)` and in bivariate hypothesis testing using appropriate tests`(Pearson’s Chi-squared test, Wilcoxon rank sum test and Fisher’s exact test)`.

### Sociodemographic Characteristics

The @tbl-descriptive-demo and @tbl-descriptive-ses below provide a breakdown of the socio-demographic characteristics for each group. The study population had a median age of 31 years (IQR: 25-43), with a gender distribution of 64% female and 36% males. Marital status varied, with 49% married, 44% signle and 3.4% divorced or widowed. The study reveals significant socio-economic differences between IDPs and host community members. Educational levels significantly differed, with more IDPs having university (48% vs. 40%) and post-graduate education (25% vs. 11%) (p \< .001). Occupation post-conflict showed a significant shift, with professional employment decreasing among IDPs (from 44% to 19%) and unemployment rising (42% vs. 34%) (p \< .001). IDPs more frequently lived in host communities (42%) and rented accommodations (22%) than host community members, who predominantly owned homes (82%) (p \< .001). Housing conditions also varied significantly, with fewer IDPs reporting good conditions (28% vs. 48%) (p \< .001). Median monthly income before the conflict was higher for IDPs (Mdn = 200) than for host community members (Mdn = 120) (p \< .001), but post-conflict income levels showed no significant difference (p = .4). Income satisfaction was low overall, with no significant group difference (p = .062) as shown in @fig-income-plot and @tbl-descriptive-ses .

When looking at displacement pattern through @fig-sankey using Sankey diagram illustrating the movement of displaced persons from various states due to conflict, providing a visual representation of the origins and destinations of these individuals. The nodes on the left side of the diagram represent the states of origin, while the ones on the right side denote the localities where displaced persons have relocated. The analysis reveals that **Khartoum (215/240)** is the highest state of origin, contributing the largest number of displaced persons. Following Khartoum, **Aj Jazerah** and **River Nile** are the next significant states of origin. In contrast, **Sennar**, **Red Sea**, and **White Nile** have contributed the least number of displaced persons.

**Friendships**: Among the 260 IDPs surveyed, 47% reported having a few friends, 40% had many friends, and 13% had no friends within the host community.

**Acceptance**: Of 256 respondents, 59% always felt welcomed, 34% sometimes felt welcomed, and 7% never felt welcomed by the host community.

**Social Activity Engagement**: Engagement was high, with 47% of 252 respondents always participating, 37% sometimes participating, and 16% never participating in social activities.

**Experiences of Kindness**: Among the 258 respondents, 53% sometimes experienced kindness, 28% always experienced it, and 18% never did.

**Comfort in Seeking Help**: Comfort levels varied, with 45% of 254 respondents sometimes comfortable, 26% always comfortable, and 29% never comfortable seeking help from the host community.

**Overall Social Integration**: None of the 259 respondents had low integration scores; 69% had average scores, while 31% had high scores

### Shared Values and Goals Between IDPs and Host Community

@tbl-shared-values-desc describes the levels of shared values and goals between host community members and internally displaced persons (IDPs), highlighting cultural Alignment, Mutual Respect, Collaboration, and Shared Responsibility

**Shared Cultural Values**: Of 406 respondents, 12% reported never sharing cultural values, 52% sometimes shared values, and 36% always did. There was no significant difference between host community members and IDPs *(p = .4).*

**Mutual Respect for Customs and Traditions**: Among 401 respondents, 5% never experienced mutual respect, 35% sometimes experienced it, and 60% always did. The patterns were similar for both groups *(p = .3).*

**Collaboration to Solve Community Issues**: From 396 responses, 20% never collaborated, 39% sometimes collaborated, and 41% always collaborated. The response distribution was consistent between the two groups *(p = .5).*

**Feeling of Shared Responsibility for Community Improvement**: Out of 403 respondents, 19% never felt shared responsibility, 30% sometimes felt it, and 50% always felt it. There was a trend towards more host community members (55%) always feeling shared responsibility compared to IDPs (48%), but this was not statistically significant *(p = .060).*

**Overall Shared Values Score**: The shared values score, categorized into low, average, or high, showed 22% of respondents with low scores, 64% with average scores, and 14% with high scores. The distribution was similar between host community members and IDPs *(p \> .9).*

### Levels of Perceived Equity and Justice in IDPs and Host Communities

The levels of perceived equity and justice of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and host community members, this was assessed in terms of their access to services, participation in decision-making, experiences of discrimination, and support from organizations, for more details see @tbl-social-support-desc.

**Equal Access to Basic Services** Among the 410 respondents, 93% agreed or strongly agreed that there should be equal access to basic services. Responses were similar between host community members and IDPs (p = .5).

**Inclusiveness in Decision-Making Processes** There was a significant difference (p = .008) regarding inclusiveness in community decision-making. A higher proportion of IDPs (59%) agreed that decision-making processes were inclusive compared to host community members (43%). Conversely, 26% of host community members disagreed, compared to 15% of IDPs.

**Prevalence of Discrimination Based on Status** Perceived discrimination based on displacement status differed significantly (p \< .001). While 44% of participants disagreed or strongly disagreed with experiencing discrimination, IDPs were more likely to disagree (41%) compared to host community members (31%).

**Equitable Support from Humanitarian Organizations and Government Policies** Responses were similar between the groups regarding equitable support (p = .6). A total of 62% disagreed or strongly disagreed that support should be equitable, with 64% of IDPs and 60% of host community members holding this view.

**Equal Employment and Economic Opportunities** Perceptions of equal employment and economic opportunities did not differ significantly (p = .4). Overall, 65% agreed or strongly agreed that opportunities should be equal, with 66% of IDPs and 67% of host community members expressing this view.

**Equal Rights and Legal Protections** Both groups showed similar perceptions of equal rights and legal protections (p = .2). Most participants agreed or strongly agreed (96%), with slightly higher agreement among host community members (98%) compared to IDPs (94%).

**Overall Perceived Equality and Justice Score** The scores were categorized into low, average, or high. Of the 410 respondents, 62% had an average score, 24% had a high score, and 14% had a low score. The distribution was similar between host community members and IDPs, with no significant difference (p = .2).

### Levels of Perceived of Social Cohesion of IDPs and Host Communities

When querying about the perceived (subjective) levels of social cohesion among host community members and internally displaced persons (IDPs), focusing on current cohesion levels and perceived changes over time as presented in @tbl-perception-cohesion in more details.

**Perceived Level of Social Cohesion**: Among the 410 respondents, 12% reported low social cohesion, 60% reported acceptable cohesion, and 28% reported high cohesion. The distribution of responses was similar between host community members and IDPs, with no significant difference (p = .6). Specifically, 11% of host community members and 12% of IDPs reported low cohesion, while 59% of host community members and 62% of IDPs reported acceptable cohesion. High cohesion was reported by 31% of host community members and 26% of IDPs.

**Improvement in Social Cohesion Over Time**: Out of 410 respondents, 15% felt that social cohesion was regressing, 30% saw no difference or were unsure, and 55% believed it was improving. Host community members were more optimistic, with 62% reporting improvement compared to 52% of IDPs. Conversely, 13% of host community members and 17% of IDPs felt cohesion was regressing. These differences, however, were not statistically significant (p = .12).

## Levels of Resilience Among IDPs Compared to Host Communities

In @tbl-resilience, the levels of resilience among host community members and internally displaced persons (IDPs), focusing on psychological well-being (psychological Resilience), social support (Social Resilience), economic resources (Economic Resilience), preparedness for environmental challenges (Environmental Resilience), and overall resilience scores.

**Psychological Resilience** by asking the degree of **psychological well-being and coping mechanisms**: Among 410 respondents, 26% reported low psychological well-being, 57% reported moderate levels, and 17% reported high levels. IDPs tended to report lower psychological well-being compared to host community members (p \< .001), with 29% of IDPs reporting low levels versus 20% of host community members.

**Social Resilience through availability and effectiveness of social support networks**: Responses indicated that 48% perceived social support networks as poor, 40% as acceptable, and 12% as good, with no significant difference between IDPs and host community members (p = .7).

**Economic resilience** asking about the **current economic resources and livelihood opportunities**: Participants reported weak economic resources (50%), moderate resources (42%), and strong resources (8%). There was no significant difference between IDPs and host community members (p = .4).

**Environmental Resilience in terms of preparedness and adaptation to environmental challenges**: showed 33% poorly prepared, 48% moderately prepared, and 19% well-prepared for environmental challenges. IDPs were less likely to feel well-prepared compared to host community members (p \< .001).

**Overall Resilience Score**: The score categorized into low, average, or high showed that 22% had a low score, 62% had an average score, and 16% had a high score. IDPs were more likely to have a low resilience score compared to host community members (p \< .001).

### Associations Between Various Variables and Levels of Perceived Social Cohesion

When testing the associations between various variables and the perceived level of cohesion using bivariate analyses as presented in @tbl-social-cohesion-assoc, we found the following:

**Significant Associations:**

1.  **Age**: There is a significant association between age and perceived level of social cohesion (p \< .001). Younger individuals tend to report lower cohesion, with median ages of 29 for low cohesion, 30 for acceptable cohesion, and 37 for high cohesion.

2.  **Marital Status**: shows a significant association (p = .007) with social cohesion. Single individuals are more likely to report lower cohesion (56%) compared to married individuals (33%) and divorced individuals (6.3%).

3.  **Participant's Locality**: The locality of participants significantly influences social cohesion (p \< .001). For example, participants from Atbara report higher acceptable cohesion (50%) compared to those from AbuHamad (2.1%).

4.  **Education Level**: it shows a significant association (p = .049) with social cohesion. Illiterate individuals report lower cohesion (2.1%) compared to university-educated individuals (44%).

5.  **Occupation After the Armed Conflict**: There is a significant association (p = .023) between occupation after the armed conflict and social cohesion. Laborers report lower cohesion (19%) compared to professional employees (33%).

6.  **Type of Shelter**: Type of shelter significantly influences social cohesion (p \< .001). Individuals in rented accommodations report lower cohesion (23%) compared to those in owned homes (33%).

7.  **Duration of Residence in Host Community**: Duration of residence shows a significant association (p \< .001) with social cohesion. Longer durations are associated with higher levels of cohesion (median of 12 months for high cohesion).

8.  **Prevalence of Discrimination Based on IDP or Host Community Status**: There is a significant association (p \< .001) between perceived discrimination and social cohesion. Those who strongly agree with discrimination tend to report lower cohesion (8.3%) compared to those who strongly disagree (31%).

9.  **Healthcare Services:** There is a strong link between healthcare accessibility and social cohesion (p \< 0.001). Those who find healthcare easily accessible tend to report higher cohesion (21%) compared to those with low (10%) and acceptable (17%) cohesion. On the other hand, individuals who find healthcare difficult to access are more likely to report low (42%) and high (46%) cohesion compared to acceptable (23%).

10. **Education Opportunities:** Education accessibility also shows a significant association with social cohesion (p = 0.005). Respondents who perceive education as easily accessible report higher cohesion (34%) compared to those with low (19%) and acceptable (29%) cohesion. Conversely, those who find education difficult to access are more likely to report high (36%) and low (29%) cohesion compared to acceptable (23%).

**Non-Significant Associations:**

-   **Demographic Factors**: Gender does not show a significant association with social cohesion (p = .4).

-   **Displacement and Economic Factors**: Displacement status, average monthly income before and after conflict, number of times displaced, and previous displacement or residence in another host community do not significantly associate with social cohesion (all p \> 0.05).

-   **Infrastructure:** The accessibility of infrastructure, such as roads, electricity, and water supply, does not significantly affect perceived social cohesion (p = 0.5). The responses are fairly consistent across different cohesion levels, with most people finding infrastructure moderately accessible.

#### Associations Roles of Governments and other bodies in Relation to Percieved Social Cohesion

The @tbl-roles-assoc presents the associations between the cohesion and degree of interventions of different parties to improved it, we found:

1.  **Role of Government Institutions and Authorities:**

    -   The perception of the role of government institutions is significantly associated with the level of social cohesion among respondents (p = 0.008). Specifically; respondents who perceive government institutions as supportive are more likely to report low (19%) and acceptable (17%) cohesion compared to high cohesion (11%).

2.  **Role of Religious Leaders:**

    -   Among those reporting low social cohesion, 44% perceived no role from religious leaders, compared to 38% in the acceptable cohesion group and 41% in the high cohesion group. Supportive roles from religious leaders showed a significant association (p = 0.017) with higher social cohesion levels.

3.  **Role of Tribal Sheiks:**

    -   For those with low social cohesion, 60% reported no role from tribal sheiks, compared to 44% in the acceptable cohesion group and 65% in the high cohesion group. Supportive roles from tribal sheiks were significantly associated (p = 0.017) with higher social cohesion.

4.  **Support from NGOs:**

    -   No significant associations were found between support from NGOs and social cohesion levels (p = 0.2).

5.  **Role of Youth Engagement:**

    -   Opposition to youth engagement was higher among those with low social cohesion (8.3%) compared to 1.6% in the acceptable cohesion group and none in the high cohesion group. Supportive roles from youth engagement were strongly associated (p \< 0.001) with higher social cohesion levels.

6.  **Community Involvement (People Themselves):**

    -   Those reporting low social cohesion had the highest proportion (21%) indicating opposition to community involvement, compared to 3.2% in the acceptable cohesion group and none in the high cohesion group. Strong support for community involvement showed a significant association (p \< 0.001) with higher social cohesion.

### Associations between Different Factors and Levels of Resilience

The associations between various factors and overall resilience scores in @tbl-resilience-assoc are summarized as follows:

**Gender**: Gender was not significantly associated with resilience levels (p = 0.3).

**Age**: Age showed a significant association with resilience levels (p = 0.029). The median age was 36 years (IQR = 27, 46) for low resilience, 29 years (IQR = 25, 40) for average resilience, and 35 years (IQR = 26, 45) for high resilience.

**Marital Status:** No significant association with resilience (p = 0.3).

**Participant's Locality:** Locality was significantly associated with resilience levels (p \< 0.001). Individuals from Eldamer had the highest representation in the low resilience group (47%) and the average resilience group (24%), whereas those from Shendi had the highest representation in the high resilience group (26%).

**Displacement Status:** There was a significant association between displacement status and resilience levels (p \< 0.001). A majority of individuals with low resilience were IDPs (74%), while a higher proportion of host community members exhibited high resilience (57%).

**Education Level:** No significant association with resilience (p = 0.6).

**Occupation Before the Armed Conflict:** No significant association with resilience (p = 0.7).

**Occupation After the Armed Conflict:** significantly affected resilience levels (p = 0.008). Those with high resilience were more likely to be unemployed (46%) compared to those with low resilience (39%). Additionally, a smaller percentage of laborers exhibited high resilience (20%) compared to those with low resilience (36%).

**Type of Shelter:** Type of shelter significantly influenced resilience levels (p = 0.001). Individuals owning homes were more prevalent in the high resilience group (58%) compared to those with low resilience (29%). Conversely, those residing in public buildings were more common in the low resilience group (10%) than in the high resilience group (4.6%).

**Housing Conditions**: Housing conditions were significantly associated with resilience levels (p \< 0.001). Distribution in the low resilience group was 29% with good conditions, 44% acceptable, and 27% bad. For average resilience, it was 33% good, 57% acceptable, and 9.4% bad. In the high resilience group, it was 51% good, 42% acceptable, and 7.7% bad.

**Average Monthly Income Before and after the Conflict**: they were not significantly associated with resilience levels (p = 0.074, p = 0.076 respectively).

**Income Satisfaction for Family Needs**: was significantly associated with resilience levels (p \< 0.001). In the low resilience group, 5.6% were satisfied, compared to 15% in the average resilience group and 34% in the high resilience group.

**Number of Times Displaced**: Number of times displaced was not significantly associated with resilience levels (p \> 0.9).

**Previous Displacement**: Previous displacement was not significantly associated with resilience levels (p = 0.2).

**Duration of Residence in the Host Community**: Duration of residence was not significantly associated with resilience levels (p = 0.7).

**Prevalence of Discrimination Based on Displacement**: Prevalence of discrimination was not significantly associated with resilience levels (p = 0.065).

**Availability and Accessibility of basic Services:**

Overall, availability and accessibility attributes were significantly associated with resilience levels. Healthcare accessibility was notably linked to higher resilience scores, *p\<.001*; 37% of respondents with high resilience found healthcare easily accessible, compared to 15% with average resilience and 10% with low resilience. Conversely, 17% of those with high resilience reported difficult access to healthcare, versus 33% with average resilience and 38% with low resilience. Similarly, education accessibility was positively correlated with resilience, *p = .003*; 48% of high resilience respondents reported easy access to education, compared to 27% with average resilience and 21% with low resilience. Difficult access to education was reported by only 14% of high resilience individuals, compared to 28% with average resilience and 34% with low resilience. Infrastructure accessibility also significantly impacted resilience, *p \<.001*; 28% of those with high resilience found infrastructure easily accessible, compared to 12% with average resilience and 5.6% with low resilience. Difficulties in accessing infrastructure were reported by 18% of high resilience respondents, compared to 38% with average resilience and 49% with low resilience.

2.  **Role of Religious Leaders:** Supportive roles from religious leaders were significantly associated (p \< 0.001) with higher resilience scores. Participants with high resilience scores showed a higher proportion (78%) perceiving supportive roles from religious leaders, compared to 55% in the average group and none in the low resilience group.

3.  **Role of Tribal Sheiks:** There was a significant association (p = 0.049) between supportive roles from tribal sheiks and higher resilience scores. Supportive roles from tribal sheiks were more prevalent among those with high resilience scores (68%), compared to 43% in the average group and none in the low resilience group.

4.  **Support from NGOs:** Although not statistically significant (p = 0.069), supportive roles from NGOs were more commonly perceived among those with high resilience scores (35%), compared to 29% in the average group and 0.8% in the low resilience group.

5.  **Role of Youth Engagement:** There was no significant association (p = 0.2) between roles of youth engagement and resilience scores.

6.  **Community Involvement (People Themselves):** High levels of community involvement were strongly associated (p \< 0.001) with higher resilience scores, with 91% of those reporting high resilience scores indicating supportive community involvement. This was compared to 64% in the average group and 6.7% in the low resilience group.

### Associations Between Wellbeing Attributes with Levels of Resilience

The associations between various wellbeing attributes and levels of resilience are summarized in @tbl-health-resilience the detailed findings for each attribute:

1.  **Health Status (last 6 months)**: Significant association with resilience (p \< 0.001). Low resilience groups reported worse health (37% bad), while high resilience groups reported better health (38% good), indicating better health correlates with higher resilience.

2.  **Physical Health Status**: Significant association with resilience levels (p \< 0.001). Low resilience groups rated their physical health worse (18% as worst), compared to high resilience groups (0% as worst), showing better physical health relates to higher resilience.

3.  **Relationships with Family**: Significant association with resilience levels (p = 0.004). Low resilience groups rated family relationships lower (5.6% as worst), whereas high resilience groups rated them higher (69% as best), indicating better family relationships enhance resilience.

4.  **Relationships with Friends**: Significant association with resilience levels (p \< 0.001). Low resilience groups rated friendships worse (10% as worst), while high resilience groups rated them better (43% as best), suggesting stronger friendships improve resilience.

5.  **Worry about Global Events**: Significant association with resilience levels (p \< 0.001). Low resilience groups were most worried (52% as most worried), whereas high resilience groups were less worried (26% as most worried), indicating less worry correlates with higher resilience.

6.  **Optimism about the Next 12 Months**: Significant association with resilience levels (p \< 0.001). Low resilience groups were less optimistic (37% as least optimistic), while high resilience groups were more optimistic (43% as most optimistic), showing greater optimism relates to higher resilience.
